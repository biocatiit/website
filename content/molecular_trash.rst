                **Fig. 1.** In this e-coli cell, the proteins (shown in blue) crowd
                around ribosomes (purple). These regions have a high
                concentration of protein, typically greater than 30 percent,
                which limits the ensemble of states into which the
                proteins can bend themselves.

        Using a combination of x-ray crystallography, mutational
        analysis, and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements,
        the researchers from the Samuel Lunenfeld
        Research Institute, the Cellgene Corporation, the University
        of Western Ontario, and the University of Toronto were able
        to reveal important new information regarding the role of the
        D-domain in the E3 ligase. Solution of the structures of the
        Cdc4 (Fig. 1) and β-TrCP D-domains reveals a common fold.
        Each fold is composed of three α helices that associate in a
        right-handed superhelical manner to form a parallel dimer. Of
        interest to the function of these proteins is that the
        sequences of the D-domains for Cdc4 and β-TrCP share
        only two conserved residues among the 16 amino acids
        involved in the dimerization interface. However, in both structures
        the dimerization interface is hydrophobic in nature, with
        variability between the two proteins imparting specificity of
        binding between different D-domains.

        In order to learn more about how D-domain dimerization
        affects E3 ligase functions such as substrate recognition and
        ubiquitin conjugation, the team performed mutational analyses
        on the Cdc4 molecule. They found that dimerization of
        the D-domain is essential for the function of the full-length Cdc4 protein and showed that two residues were critical for
        dimer formation. However, although Cdc4 proteins that contained
        mutated D-domains did not dimerize, they were still
        able to bind substrates. Analysis of the catalytic activity of
        the ubiquitination reaction, however, revealed that the catalytic
        attachment of ubiquitin was impaired in these mutants.
        Therefore, it appears that dimerization of Cdc4 mediated
        through the D-domain is important for catalytic efficiency but
        not for substrate recognition.

        SAXS analysis provided further insight into the importance
        of D-domain dimerization and its involvement in the
        catalytic efficiency of the ubiquitination reaction. Catalytic
        attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues
        in a protein that may be spaced at different distances along
        the protein presents a situation that would be facilitated by
        an accommodating catalytic site. SAXS analysis of Ddomain
        plus F-box domain constructs revealed that,
        although the distance between these domains is quite constrained,
        the configuration created by dimerization brings the
        substrate binding domain of the F-box into coplanar contact
        with the E2 catalytic enzyme. This allows for a wide variety
        of geometric configurations to fit within the catalytic domain,
        increasing catalytic efficiency. Together, this analysis of Ddomain
        dimerization suggests that the flexibility of the system
        comes from dimerization imposed by the D-domain as
        shown in the crystal structure and the coplanar configuration
        created by dimerization that allows substrates of varying
        sizes and configurations to be available for polyubiquitination
        and subsequent disposal by the proteasome.
