		In eukaryotic cells, diverse stresses
		trigger coalescence of various RNAbinding
		proteins into so-called stress
		granules. In vitro, stress-granuleassociated
		proteins have been
		observed to demix to form liquids,
		hydrogels, and other assemblies.
		Demixing of an abundant RNA-binding
		protein into hydrogel droplets,
		triggered by stress-associated
		physiological conditions, appears to
		promote cell fitness during stress.
		
		Here, a U Chicago based team lead
		by D. Allan Drummond and Tobin
		Sosnick showed that poly(A)-binding
		protein (Pab1 in yeast), a defining
		marker of stress granules, phase
		separates and forms hydrogels in vitro
		upon exposure to physiological stress conditions. Other RNA-binding proteins depend
		upon low-complexity regions (LCRs) or RNA for phase separation. Based on unique
		evolutionary patterns, the authors created LCR mutations, which systematically tune its
		biophysical properties and Pab1 phase separation in vitro and in vivo. Mutations that
		impede phase separation reduced organism fitness during prolonged stress. Such
		mutations reduce the thermal and pH sensitivity of Pab1’s demixing and, hence, reduce
		fitness during growth at high temperature and during energy depletion, indicating that
		demixing is adaptive. Together, the results illuminate a uniquely complete path from
		evolved sequence features, to phase separation, to stress-triggered demixing, and finally
		to organism fitness during stress. SEC SAXS using the BioCAT beamline 18ID at the
		Advanced Photon Source of the unstructured P domain of the poly A binding protein
		allowed examination of how its compaction related to its hydrophobicity, as tuned by
		various mutations, an important component of this model.
