                **Fig. 1.** Segments of the potyvirus soybean
                mosaic virus; several virions are
                also shown in cross-section. The symmetry
                and low-resolution structure of this virus
                are very similar to those of the
                potexvirus potato virus X, suggesting that
                flexible filamentous plant viruses share a
                common coat protein fold and approximate
                helical symmetry.

        Over the years, scientists have has
        invested much time and effort searching
        for methods to learn more about the
        structures of flexible filamentous
        viruses. By doing so, they hoped to find
        ways of combating the economic devastation
        resulting from crop loss due to
        viral infestations. The researchers in
        this study, from Vanderbilt University,
        the Boston University School of
        Medicine, the Illinois Institute of
        Technology, the University of Kentucky,
        and Brookhaven National Laboratory,
        used a variety of techniques, including
        fiber diffraction data collected on the
        Bio-CAT beamline 18-ID at the APS, to
        determine that the viruses they studied,
        and by extension most flexible filamentous
        viruses, have similar coat protein
        folds and helical symmetry, with a little
        less than nine subunits per helical turn.
        This new knowledge marks great
        progress in understanding how these
        plant viruses operate and will help scientists
        figure out how to outsmart the
        viruses and prevent viral infections.

        The research team determined the
        symmetry and low-resolution structures
        of a potyvirus (soybean mosaic virus),
        and a potexvirus (potato virus X).
        These viruses represent the two largest
        families of flexible filamentous viruses,
        the Potyviridae and the Flexiviridae. Together with some smaller families,
        they make up the largest group of plant
        viruses. These viruses are of enormous
        economic importance. Members
        of the potyvirus family account for half
        of the viral crop damage worldwide,
        but their structures had proved difficult
        to characterize because of such factors
        as flexibility, instability, and low levels
        of expression. The variety of methods
        the research team employed—fiber diffraction
        at the Bio-CAT beamline, cryoelectron
        microscopy (cryo-EM), and
        scanning transmission electron
        microscopy (STEM)—allowed them to
        overcome these problems and to finally
        produce structural data.

        The researchers obtained, for the
        first time, well-oriented fiber diffraction
        data from a potyvirus. They then used
        these data to determine radial density
        and, when combined with the STEM
        and cryo-EM data, viral symmetry. The
        cryo-EM, together with the fiber diffraction
        data, allowed the group to determine
        the overall viral structure and produce
        a reconstructed image that
        showed the subunit shape and
        arrangement in this potyvirus (Fig. 1).

        For comparison, the group then
        went on to study the structure of potato
        virus X at a comparable resolution and
        to confirm the previously characterized
        symmetry of this virus. The structures
        and symmetries of the two viruses
        were unexpectedly similar, suggesting
        that these two virus families, the
        Potyviridae and the Flexiviridae, are
        structurally related.

        The latter result is surprising in
        that previous work showed little similarity
        in the proteins making up the coats
        of these viruses. Now that good structural data are available, however, the
        evidence points to similarity and evolutionary
        relationships between soybean
        mosaic virus and potato virus X, and
        by implication among all flexible filamentous
        plant viruses. This is good
        news to crop scientists concerned with
        finding ways to combat viral infestations.
        It means that when an anti-viral
        treatment based on viral structure
        works against one virus, there is a
        good chance it will work on others in
        this group. How viruses so successfully
        infest plants has just become a little
        less secretive.
