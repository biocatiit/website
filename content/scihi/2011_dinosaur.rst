        How does one prove that the protein isolated from a 68-million-year-old
        dinosaur bone is not a contamination from the intervening millenia or
        from the lab? This is the task of a research team who say they have
        isolated peptides of the common structural protein, collagen, from
        bones of Tyrannosaurus rex and Brachylophosauraus canadensis. Although
        the team had previously presented multiple lines of evidence supporting
        the veracity of the find, the fact that the age of the peptides far
        exceeds any previous predictions of how long a protein could resist
        degradation has generated controversy. In their current work, the
        researchers used x-ray diffraction data collected utilizing the BioCAT
        18-ID x-ray beamline at the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scienceâ€™s
        Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory to generate a
        model of collagen structure on which to overlay the location of the
        putative dinosaur peptides. The results provide support for a model in
        which the dinosaur peptides were protected from degradation due to
        their location within the collagen fibril. This is important evidence
        supporting the ancient origin of these peptides and the mechanism by
        which they were preserved. In addition, this new knowledge of collagen
        structure could be used in the design of highly stable collagenous
        scaffolds to promote bone and tissue regeneration in humans.

        Collagen is a common structural protein found in animals. It makes up
        about 25% of the human body and is a major component of tendons,
        ligaments, skin, and bone. Collagen literally holds the body together
        and its high tensile strength is attributed to its fibrillar structure.
        Recent evidence has shown that the collagen fibril is made up of
        microfibrillar units. Three polypeptides wind into a triple helical
        structure to form a collagen molecule. Five collagen molecules twist
        around each other to make microfibrils which then pack next to each
        other to form larger characteristic collagen fibrils. The amino acid
        sequence of collagen is highly conserved, so it is possible to compare
        peptides from diverse and ancient species.

        To explain the remarkable durability of dinosaur collagen, the researchers
        from Orthovita Inc., North Carolina State University, Montana State
        University, the University of Pennsylvania, the Beth Israel Deaconess
        Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, the Harvard-Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology Division of Health Sciences and Technology, The
        University of Manchester, Manchester, The University of York, York, and
        the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) hypothesized that areas of
        the protein deeply within the complex fibrillar structure might be
        preferentially protected from degradation. To test this, they set out
        to create a model on which to map specific amino acid sequences along
        and within the collagen fibril to see where their dinosaur peptides
        matched up. This was achieved by using x-ray diffraction data from the
        rat tendon collagen I microfibril and fibril in situ collected at the
        BioCAT beamline to construct a model showing the orientation of the
        molecules of the triple helix within the microfibril.

        According to research team leader Joseph Orgel of IIT, "The approach
        of our team over the last decade has been to study the structure of
        collagen in its context, as fibrils located within intact tissue samples.
        By far our most important work has been in developing the x-ray
        diffraction techniques and facilities [at BioCAT] to allow us to
        understand collagen structure in situ. Without this understanding,
        we would not have been able to perform the analysis undertaken in
        this recent work." Using this approach, the team was able identify
        the location of collagen sequences that are known to interact with
        other molecules and those which would be expected to be protected in
        the interior of the fibrillar structure. Sequencing and mapping of
        11 dinosaur peptides that represented 8 sequences revealed that the
        dinosaur sequences were from regions of the protein that were partly
        protected by molecular packing. This localization could be responsible
        for protecting the peptides over the millenia.

        Further comparison of the sequences to human collagen provided other
        clues to how these particular peptides might have been preserved.
        First, there were very few acidic residues found in five of the
        sequences, meaning their hydrophobic nature would limit their solubility
        and availability for degradation. Also, few of the peptides represented
        regions of collagen containing sites targeted by breakdown enzymes
        and none of them were from the most unstable region of the protein.
        These features provide hard biochemical evidence for why these particular
        peptides endured for such a long time.

        Does this work satisfy the skeptics? Not yet, but having a new mechanism
        for how ancient proteins might be preserved is a dinosaur-sized step in
        the right direction.
