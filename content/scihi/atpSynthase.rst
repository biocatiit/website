        Hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives many
        of the vast range of energy-consuming processes within a cell.
        The ATP synthase enzyme is a molecular motor that couples
        proton movement to ATP synthesis. In the rotational model of
        the enzyme, protons flow down an electrochemical gradient,
        through the membrane-embedded F0 portion of ATP synthase,
        causing a ring of c subunits to rotate. The attached “central
        stalk” rotates in turn and interacts sequentially with three β subunits
        in the ring-shaped F1 portion, whose conformational
        changes catalyze ATP synthesis.

        In this model, F1 must be held against, and stationary relative
        to, the rotating central stalk. The dimeric b subunit, or
        “second stalk,” of F0 serves as an elongated external scaffold
        that holds the two portions together in this way. This study
        focuses on a model for the isolated dimerization domain of the
        b subunit of Escherichia coli, derived from solution small-angle
        x-ray scattering (SAXS) of the dimeric domain and x-ray crystallography
        of the monomer (Fig. 1) carried out at the
        Biophysics Collaborative Access Team beamline 18-ID. A righthanded
        α-helical coiled-coil domain is found to be consistent
        with the data.

        The E. coli second stalk is a homodimer of b subunits that
        consists of four domains. This study concentrates on residues
        62-122, which make up the dimerization domain. Initial crystallographic
        data unambiguously showed a single extended helix
        comprising residues 68-122. SAXS data indicate that the dimer
        in solution has an extended structure 95 Å long. To construct a
        model for the homodimer, researchers noted that most of the
        hydrophobic residues in the monomer are arranged in a strip
        along the helix surface and assumed that this strip constitutes
        the dimer interface. Because the strip moves around the helix
        in a right-handed sense, the model for the dimer has a righthanded
        superhelical twist.

        A parallel, two-stranded, right-handed coiled-coil has never
        been observed, although natural and designed four-stranded
        right-handed helical bundles have. To form a right-handed
        coiled-coil, a polypeptide should contain an 11-residue
        (undecad) repeating motif with hydrophobic residues at the “a”
        and “h” positions. Sequence data show that the dimerization
        domain has a well-maintained undecad repeat but a poor heptad
        repeat, which would characterize a left-handed coiled-coil.
        Mutational data also support the right-handed model. Insertion
        of alanine (A) for the hydrophilic arginine 83 (R83), which occupies
        an undecad “a” position, strengthened dimerization,
        according to circular dichroism and sedimentation data.
        Alanines substituted for arginines at positions 82 (a heptad “d”
        position) and 98 weakened the structure, indicating that the additional alanine itself was not the cause of stronger dimerization.
        SAXS data taken on the R83A protein fit a right-handed
        model only slightly better than a left-handed one.

        This model satisfies most of the available evidence, and
        there appears to be no reasonable alternative. The reason for
        such an uncommon structure is not obvious, but it may provide
        a mechanism for the proposed elastic energy storage during
        coupled rotation in ATP synthase.
