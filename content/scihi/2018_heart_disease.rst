        Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a serious, and poorly understood, heart disease
        that affects about 1 million people in the United State. DCM is a progressive
        disease with no current cure, often culminating in heart transplantation. Many
        cases of DCM are caused by inherited gene mutations often located on specific
        muscle proteins that are part of the cell machinery that allows contractions.
        One such protein is Myosin Light Chain 2 (MYL2), part of the “motor” that
        powers contraction. The investigators identified a human mutation that causes
        DCM called D94A, and created a transgenic mouse that expresses this mutation
        allowing the mouse heart muscle to be studied by a wide range of techniques
        including X-ray diffraction at the BioCAT Beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon
        Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The X-ray experiments showed that one of
        the reasons the muscle does not contract correctly is that the myosin ”motor”
        proteins  are positioned further  away from their targets than in normal heart
        muscle making it harder for them to generate the correct amounts of force to
        pump the right amount of blood into circulation when the muscle contracts. These
        malfunctioning myosin motors perturb the structure of the sarcomere, the basic
        structural building block of muscle leading to changes in the gross structure
        of the D94A hearts resulting in the eventual development of DCM, much in the
        same way as in human patients. These results suggests that in addition to other
        sarcomeric genes, the MYL2 protein may be used as a target for new drugs
        designed to treat dilated cardiomyopathy disease.
