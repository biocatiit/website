    In their continuing endeavor to understand misfolding proteins as part of
    the etiology of a variety of diseases, the Matthews lab particularly focuses
    on the different factors that impede a protein’s path from the unfolded state
    to the global free energy minimum. The complexity of the folding trajectory
    understandably depends on the size of the protein mostly because of the
    formation of intermediates many of which often stall the formation of an
    optimal native conformation.

    The triosphosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel family of proteins have very well
    characterized and conserved folding path despite large variations in sequence
    which make it an ideal group of proteins to obtain widely applicable insights
    into the folding process. Like other proteins studied before, S.solfataricus
    indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (SsIGPS) a TIM barrel protein goes
    through a burst phase followed by a relaxation phase and then eventually
    folds into the native conformation. Mutational and hydrogen exchange
    experiments have helped characterize the species found in the few millisecond
    time range of the folding process. In this study, Halloran et al., have
    used a combination of continuous flow FRET, SAXS and simulations to study
    the sub-millisecond time window. SsIGPS has 8 βα repeats arranged as a
    central β barrel encompassed by α helices. In previous studies it has been
    shown to be kinetically trapped within the first few milliseconds by forming
    an intermediate IBP which is characterized by a well-protected central (βα)4
    segment. This is followed by expansion of protection to a region spanning
    the (βα)2-6, which subsequently spreads to (βα)1-8 and finally native fold
    is achieved. The access of previous experimental systems was limited to 10s
    of milliseconds, which hampered the understanding of the burst phase.

    At BioCAT, equilibrium SAXS measurements yielded new structural information
    concerning the native, and unfolded states which were shown to have a radius
    of gyration (Rg) of 18 and 46 Å respectively. In addition, a chaotic flow
    microfluidic mixer was used to acquire time-resolved SAXS data. A ten-fold
    dilution of SsIGPS in 8 M urea using the mixer led to formation of the IBP
    state well within the 150 µs dead-time of the mixer and had an Rg of ~26 Å.
    While the Kratky plot suggested that the IBP is globular, the P(r) curve
    indicates that there are still unstructured regions and it is significantly
    different compared to the native conformation. CF-FRET, using more localized
    distances to monitor conformational changes, further corroborated the
    formation of IBP during the burst phase even before the first 50 µs. These
    observations were bolstered by conclusions drawn from coarse grained
    simulations which showed multiple trajectories that reached intermediates
    that had different combinations of native and non-native regions. It was
    also shown that not all trajectories had equal likelihood of achieving the
    native state. The experimental data were however remarkably consistent with
    the observations made during simulations and both the approaches strongly
    supported and further elucidated the models drawn from the hydrogen exchange
    experiments.
