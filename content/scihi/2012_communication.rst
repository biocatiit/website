                Multivalency drives phase separation and probably drives a
                sol–gel transition in the droplet phase. a, Phase diagrams of
                multivalent SH3 and PRM proteins. The concentrations are in
                terms of the modules. The red circles indicate phase separation,
                and the blue circles indicate no phase separation. b, The Rg
                values determined from SAXS data that were collected during
                titrations of PRM proteins into SH35. Closed circles indicate
                the absence of phase separation; open circles indicate data
                collected on the supernatant phase,which was separated from
                the droplets by centrifugation. The titrations used PRM4
                (orange), PRM2 (blue), PRM1 (green) and PRM(H)1 (red). The
                error bars represent the s.d. calculated fromfive to ten
                independent measurements of intensity versus scattering angle

        In many biological processes, various substances undergo phase transitions,
        where they are transformed from one state (solid, liquid, or gas) to
        another. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Proteins (WASP) function as intracellular
        signaling molecules, and one member of the family, N-WASP, interacts
        with two other proteins, forming a complex that plays an integral role
        in the regulation of the cell’s internal scaffold. This interaction
        provides a system for investigation of phase transitions that result
        from multivalent interactions. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS)
        and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques at the APS, researchers
        investigated interactions between engineered multivalent substances.
        They described the occurrence of sharp liquid-liquid-demixing phase
        separations corresponding to transformation between small complexes
        and large polymers at the molecular level, leading to the production
        of micrometer-diameter liquid droplets in aqueous solution. They also
        examined the phase transition that occurs in relation to N-WASP activity,
        and found that phosphorylation of one of its interactive proteins by a
        kinase enzyme plays an integral role in the transformation. Understanding
        the results of this research will be important in guiding future
        studies to further evaluate the role of phase transitions in biological
        systems.

        Phase transitions occur widely throughout nature, and involve transformation
        of a substance from one phase to another, in relation to changes in
        external conditions. One well-known example is that of evaporation,
        where liquid water is transformed to water vapor. The interaction of
        multivalent (multiple unit) small molecules leads to “sol-gel transitions”
        which involve sharp transformations between small assemblies and large
        polymer gels. In these processes, the critical transition point at which
        phase transition occurs relates to the physical properties of the
        monomeric form of the molecule, and the polymer can take on various
        physical forms, from liquid to solid.

        In biological systems, many processes involve interactions between
        forms of molecules, including intracellular signaling. The WASP family
        of proteins acts as intracellular signaling molecules in the regulation
        of the cellular scaffolding, or cytoskeleton. They are involved in
        transfer of signals from receptors on the cell surface where they bind,
        to the inside of the cell where they promote linking together, or
        polymerization, of filaments of the cytoskeletal protein actin. N-WASP
        is a member of this family with highest levels in the nervous system,
        and, together with its 2 protein partners (NCK and phosphorylated
        nephrin), represents a system for investigation of phase transitions
        that result from multivalent interactions.

        Multivalency has been investigated mostly in relation to extracellular
        substances binding to receptors on the cell surface. In this context,
        protein systems aggregate to form cross-linked networks, especially
        precipitates, but also liquid-like gels. This study, however, aimed
        to investigate multivalency in relation to intracellular molecules,
        and in particular to determine whether these systems also experience
        sharp transformations to polymers.

        Using DLS and SAXS techniques at the APS to evaluate reactions, the
        researchers showed that interactions between synthetic, multivalent
        substances result in sharp liquid-liquid-demixing phase separations,
        in which two liquid substances separate to produce 1-50 µm diameter
        liquid droplets in aqueous solution. At the molecular level, this
        correlates with a transformation between small complexes and large
        polymers.

        When they investigated N-WASP in this way, the researchers discovered
        that when it interacts biologically with its 2 protein partners, a
        phase transition occurs that promotes formation of the Arp2/3 complex -
        a 7-subunit protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
        This complex binds to existing actin filaments, enabling new filaments
        to grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. This
        transformation is regulated by the degree of phosphorylation of nephrin,
        demonstrating how kinase enzymes can be involved in the control of
        this aspect of the system.

        The exact mechanisms whereby the properties of a substance at the
        molecular level correlate to those at the macroscopic level are still
        to be determined. However, this study has provided important insight
        into the importance of these transformations in biology, providing a
        mechanism by which multivalent interactions could lead to sharp phase
        transitions that play an integral role in various important processes,
        including intracellular signaling. The results of this study will
        therefore help guide further research in this field, and since
        multivalent systems are so common throughout nature, it seems possible
        that phase transitions may be involved in various other aspects of
        biology such as spatial organization within cells, and biochemical
        regulation of information transfer.
