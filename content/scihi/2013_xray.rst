                Mn and Fe distributions in the choroid plexus. XRF images of
                the Fe (A) and Mn (B) distributions in the choroid plexus (CP)
                within the lateral ventricle (lv) as identified by increased
                Fe signal. Images are Bregma −0.48 mm coronal sections of
                untreated rats (top) and Mn treated (bottom). Yellow dashed
                lines indicate the boundary between the ventricle and the
                labeled structures (CPu and HPC, hippocampal formation). The
                Fe signal shows the presence of CP (containing blood) within
                the ventricle. Mn concentration in the ventricle is lower
                than in adjacent brain structures of the CPu and HPC indicating
                clearance of Mn from the CP. All values given are in µg/g. Scale
                bar represents a length of 2 mm.

        Manganese (Mn) is an essential element required in trace amounts for
        proper body function. However, despite its vital role in enzymatic
        reactions, excessive Mn exposure leads to a condition known as manganism
        or Mn induced parkinsonism. Clinical signs and symptoms of manganism
        closely resemble those of Parkinson's disease (PD) and both diseases
        are pathologically associated with damage to the basal ganglia. While
        this condition was first diagnosed about 170 years ago, the mechanism
        of the neurotoxic action of Mn remains unknown. Moreover, the possibility
        that Mn exposure combined with other genetic and environmental factors
        can contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease has been
        discussed in the literature and several epidemiological studies have
        demonstrated a correlation between Mn exposure and an elevated risk of
        Parkinson's disease. Here, we introduce X-ray fluorescence imaging as
        a new quantitative tool for analysis of the Mn distribution in the brain
        with high spatial resolution. The animal model employed mimics deficits
        observed in affected human subjects. The obtained maps of Mn distribution
        in the brain demonstrate the highest Mn content in the globus pallidus,
        the thalamus, and the substantia nigra pars compacta. To test the
        hypothesis that Mn transport into/distribution within brain cells
        mimics that of other biologically relevant metal ions, such as iron,
        copper, or zinc, their distributions were compared. It was demonstrated
        that the Mn distribution does not follow the distributions of any of
        these metals in the brain. The majority of Mn in the brain was shown
        to occur in the mobile state, confirming the relevance of the chelation
        therapy currently used to treat Mn intoxication. In cells with
        accumulated Mn, it can cause neurotoxic action by affecting the
        mitochondrial respiratory chain. This can result in increased
        susceptibility of the neurons of the globus pallidus, thalamus, and
        substantia nigra pars compacta to various environmental or genetic
        insults. The obtained data is the first demonstration of Mn
        accumulation in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and thus, can
        represent a link between Mn exposure and its potential effects for
        development of Parkinson's disease.

        The Pushkar collaboration is one of the success stories of our XFM
        developments leading to two publications in 2012. A relative latecomer
        to our facility she is making excellent use of our existing scanning
        diffraction imaging capabilities in combination with XFM. She provides
        a Driving Biomedical Project for our planned future developments.
