        For some time now, proteins known as amyloids
        have been implicated in the onset and advance of Alzheimer’s
        and other diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. One of the curious
        aspects of linking these proteins to diseases is that it seems to
        be primarily unusual protein folding and assembly that leads
        to disease. This is especially so in the case of Alzheimer’s and
        cerebral amyloid angiopathy, where mutations such as the Iowa
        mutant are associated with familial inheritance and early onset
        of the disease. Patients carrying the mutation develop neuritic
        plaques and large deposits of the mutant protein in cerebral
        blood vessels. Exactly how the protein does so much damage
        has been the subject of intense recent research, including
        these fi ndings by researchers from The University of Chicago,
        the National Institutes of Health, and the Illinois Institute of
        Technology. With the help of the BioCAT 18-ID beamline at
        the APS, the team used x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy,
        and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to show
        how the mutant and normal proteins differ with respect to
        folding and assembly. What the research group found goes
        a long way toward explaining how the mutant protein is able
        to create so much havoc in tissues and how -amyloids relate
        to disease.

        The researchers focused on the β-amyloid coded by the Iowa
        mutation, which differs from the normal protein by only one amino
        acid. They found that the mutant protein, known as D23N-Aβ40,
        forms fibrils much more rapidly than the normal protein and does
        so without first undergoing the lag phase observed for the normal
        protein. X-ray diffraction patterns from the mutant protein showed
        cross-β patterns and other attributes that differed from the normal protein.
        Observing the mutant protein using electron microscopy, the team found that
        it occurs in more than one morphotype (organisms that are classified together on the
        basis of similar physical features without knowledge of their genetic
        relationship).

        Further investigations using NMR spectroscopy showed that
        only a minority of the mutant protein fibrils looked like the typical
        β-amyloid protein fibrils, which exhibit a parallel β-sheet structure.
        Thus, a majority of the mutant protein fibrils looked quite different
        from the normal fibrils. Further examination of the mutant fibrils
        indicated that they are put together differently and had a smaller average
        diameter when compared to the normal fibrils.

        In perhaps the most exciting of the new findings presented by
        the investigators, a majority of the mutant fibrils exhibited a structure
        consistent with antiparallel β-sheets and are thus assembled quite
        differently from the parallel β-sheet of the normal protein. This clear
        difference in orientation between the mutant and normal molecules
        represents one of the first truly distinguishing characteristics
        of the mutant protein and will certainly lead to better ways of
        detecting and treating the resulting disease states.

        Using these new data, the research team proposed a link
        between aberrant assembly and tissue pathology of the patients
        carrying the mutation for D23NAβ40 (Fig. 1). Further work is
        planned to answer questions about how exactly the mutant
        protein assembles to produce some molecules that look like the normal
        protein, even though most of them do not. Previous work by the research
        group showed that examining the mechanisms for bends or folds
        between sheets holds promise for explaining these differences and
        allowed them to construct a model consistent with their current results.
        Additional questions include how the substitution of a single amino acid
        in the mutant protein allows it to form the very different anti-parallel
        β-sheet structure. And the large protein deposits characteristic of
        the disease in patients carrying the Iowa mutation, as well as the
        frequency with which β-amyloid protein is transported into the blood
        vessel wall, may also be related to how and when the fibrils
        are assembled.

        The work reported by the research team points to two characteristics of
        proteins that can never be ignored: the amino acid sequence and how the protein
        is assembled. In the case of the β-amyloid proteins, changing one
        amino acid creates a mutant protein that can assemble quite differently
        and lead to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, an understanding of
        which may lead to the development of new therapeutic options.
