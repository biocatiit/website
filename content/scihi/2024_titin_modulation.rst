            Molecular changes to cardiac sarcomeres after 50% titin cleavage.
            A. Schematic of a half sarcomere with myosin heads shown in ON
            (green) and off (gray) states and TEV protease recognition site
            (scissors). B. X-ray diffraction pattern of permeabilized TC
            papillary muscle. C-H. Changes in diffraction features with
            changes in SL before and after protease treatment.

    The Frank-Starling Law of the Heart states that the heart's stroke volume
    increases with greater preload due to increased venous return, allowing the
    heart to adapt to varying circulatory demands. At the molecular level,
    increasing preload increases sarcomere length (SL), which alters structures
    within the sarcomere that are correlated to increased calcium sensitivity
    upon activation. The titin protein, spanning the half-sarcomere acts as a
    spring in the I-band, applies a SL-dependent passive force on the myosin
    containing thick filaments changing its structure and functional properties.
    Altered titin-based forces play a crucial role in the etiology of many
    cardiomyopathies; however, the disease state obscures titin’s role,
    impeding therapeutic solutions.

    The authors studied titin’s specific role using the titin cleavage (TC)
    mouse model, where a tobacco-etch virus protease (TEVP) recognition
    site is inserted into distal I-band titin and allows for rapid, specific
    cleavage of titin in an otherwise-healthy sarcomere. Titin cleavage
    decreases myocardial passive force and stiffness while altering
    cardiomyocyte tensegrity. Structural changes in the sarcomere as a
    function of stretch following 50% titin cleavage were monitored using
    small-angle X-ray diffraction. Increasing titin-based forces at longer
    SLs could stretch the cardiac thick filament, accompanied by a transition
    of some myosin heads from an inactive OFF to an active ON confirmation.
    This mechanism may increase the myosin head’s ability to form crossbridges,
    contributing to the Frank-Starling effect. The length of the thick
    filament, monitored by the spacing of the M6 meridional reflection (SM6)
    increases at longer SL and decreases with 50% titin cleavage. Other
    indicators of myosin head OFF-to-ON transitions with increasing SL before
    cleavage, including increasing M3 spacing and decreasing myosin layer line
    intensity, were blunted with 50% titin cleavage while there was no change
    in equatorial intensity ratio, I11/I10 indicating that there were no
    changes in the radial position of myosin heads, while myosin heads were
    still able to reorient. Interesting, these changes in thick filament
    length were accompanied by changes in thin filament length as measured by
    the A6 actin reflection spacing, that were also blunted by titin cleavage.
    These results support earlier suggestions that there must be a
    communication pathway, perhaps small numbers of strongly bound crossbridges,
    or myosin binding protein C. that transmits strain in the thick filaments
    to the thin filaments. The authors concluded that reducing titin-based
    forces blunts structural changes in both thick and thin filaments while
    leaving the length-dependent OFF-to-ON transition mechanism intact,
    indicating a clear role for titin in the Frank-Starling mechanism.
