                **Fig. 1.** A new method (G2G, "Global measurements to Global
                structure") has been developed for structure determination of
                large RNAs in solution using residual dipolar coupling (RDC) from NMR
                measurements, represented by the blue and red contour linked by
                black lines with residue labels; and SAXS/WAXS measurements,
                represented by gray co-centered circular rings in the background.
                The black "wave" is the RDC-structural periodicity correlation
                curve that was used to extract the orientation of the RNA
                duplexes. At the lower left is a two-dimensional (2-D) drawing
                of the topology of the 102-nt RNA. The low-center model is a
                rendering of the 2-D drawing of the topology in three-dimensional
                \(3-D) space; at the lower right is the refined 3-D ensemble of
                the 102-nt RNA structures that were restrained with RDC and SAXS
                data. (For a detailed description of the G2G method, please see

        The turnip crinkle virus has just 4054 bases in its genetic code, making
        it among the smallest and simplest of the single-component RNA viruses that
        infect plants. Moreover, sub-viral strands of TCV's RNA can use the
        enzyme polymerase to replicate without the rest of the virus being involved. So
        molecular biologists find this virus useful as templates for genetic studies of
        replication and recombination.

        TCV also uses several structural elements of messenger RNA to make
        translation of its genetic code more efficient. This allows it to replicate rapidly
        in the infected host plant without being subjected to the host cell self-defense
        system. Some of these structural elements also work together to trigger
        translation and boost efficiency. Now, researchers from the National Cancer
        Institute at Frederick; Johns Hopkins University; Argonne; the University of
        Maryland College Park; and the National Institutes of Health have
        obtained the three-dimensional solution structure of one such structural element:
        a ribosome-binding element in TCV. The researchers developed a
        novel method that allowed them to combine the benefits of SAXS/WAXS
        with nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1). The SAXS/WAXS experiments
        were performed at XSD beamlines 12-IID-C,D and and BioCAT beamline 18-ID
        at the APS.

        TCV lacks the known translational enhancers, the so-called 5' cap and the
        3' poly(A) tail, which are normally used for starting protein synthesis in animals,
        plants, and fungi. As such, understanding how translation is initiated and
        enhanced to make TCV infectious to host plants seemingly relies on the
        structural element located in the region after the protein synthesis stop signal
        (stop codon). This region is called the 3′ untranslated region (3' UTR).
        This structural element helps the virus to hijack the host plant's protein factory,
        the ribosome, and use it to replicate the viral proteins without hindrance from
        the plant's self-defense mechanisms. One of the problems facing researchers
        trying to understand the underlying molecular biology is that the two key
        processes, translation and replication, seem to be mutually exclusive as they
        operate in the opposite direction, one synthesizing RNA, the other proteins.

        The 3' UTR in TCV has a cap-independent translation element (CITE),
        within which is a ribosome-binding structural element (RBSE). It is this
        section that hijacks the large subunit of the host ribosome to make viral proteins.
        There is a large symmetric loop within the RBSE, which plays a key role
        in coordinating translation and replication. The structure determination
        achived by the researchers in this study offers the global structure of this loop,
        the 102-nucleotide RBSE RNA. The structure reveals that it shares almost
        every structural feature with transfer RNA (tRNA) in solution, as if the 102-nt
        RBSE were a large cousin of tRNA. There are two hairpins, H1 and H2,
        linked by a 7-nucleotide unit, which resembles to the variation loop in tRNA
        even in its sequence, H3, and is accessible to interactions with the ribosome.

        This new global structure provides an insight into how the unit can bind to
        the ribosome and might explain how the system can switch between replication
        and protein production by revealing that H1 and H2 work together in translation
        but independently of H3, which is involved in protein synthesis through
        ribosome binding.

        This is the first experimental determination of a functional element in the
        3' UTR of RNA from any organism and could open up research into viral infectivity
        that has implications beyond this simple plant virus. The researchers feel
        that the key to the success of the study were the SAXS/WAXS experiments
        performed at APS.
