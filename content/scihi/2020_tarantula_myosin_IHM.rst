    Striated muscle contraction involves sliding of actin thin filaments along
    myosin thick filaments, controlled by calcium through thin filament
    activation. In relaxed muscle, the two heads of myosin interact with each
    other on the filament surface to form the interacting-heads motif (IHM).
    A key question is how both heads are released from the surface to approach
    actin and produce force. We used time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction
    to study tarantula muscle before and after tetani. The patterns showed that
    the IHM is present in live relaxed muscle. Tetanic contraction produced
    only a very small backbone elongation, implying that mechanosensing -
    proposed in vertebrate muscle - is not of primary importance in tarantula.
    Rather, thick filament activation results from increases in myosin
    phosphorylation that release a fraction of heads to produce force, with
    the remainder staying in the ordered IHM configuration. After the tetanus
    the released heads slowly recover towards the resting, helical ordered
    state. During this time the released heads remain close to actin and can
    quickly rebind, enhancing the force produced by post-tetanic twitches,
    structurally explaining post-tetanic potentiation. Taken together, these
    results suggest that, in addition to stretch activation in insects, two
    other mechanisms for thick filament activation have evolved to disrupt
    the interactions that establish the relaxed helices of IHMs: one in
    invertebrates, by either regulatory light chain phosphorylation (as in
    arthropods) or Ca2+-binding (in mollusks, lacking phosphorylation), and
    another in vertebrates, by mechanosensing.
