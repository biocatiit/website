    The human heart is a remarkable feat of evolutionary engineering. Beating
    about 100,000 times per day and pumping nearly 2,000 gallons of blood
    through an interconnected series of veins, arteries, and capillaries that
    spans a distance greater than 60,000 miles, the heart is the most important
    muscle in the human body. Yet, heart disease remains the number one cause
    of death in the world, demonstrating the need for more research in heart
    physiology. Now a research team has found an unlikely source of inspiration
    for understanding how the human heart works and how we might design better
    drugs for conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: tarantulas. The
    source of nightmares for arachnophobes and the household pets for
    arachnophiles are inspiring researchers to take new approaches to
    understanding diseases that alter how heart muscle cells contract and relax.
    But, before getting to the human heart, there is more to learn about the
    physiology of tarantula muscles. The researchers set out to understand how
    contractions in tarantula muscle cells are activated and why are muscle
    twitches that follow a sustained muscle contraction (post-tetanic) more
    forceful than those that don’t (pre-tetanic). Their results provide
    evidence that phosphorylation, the chemical addition of a phosphoryl
    group (PO3-) to an organic molecule, plays a key role in muscle activation
    and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) in tarantula muscles.

    Striated muscles are composed of thick and thin filaments that contain
    myosin and actin proteins, respectively. When activated, these two fibrous
    proteins interact to cause their relative sliding, resulting in the
    production of force and muscle shortening. In the fully relaxed phase, the
    researchers from the University of Massachusetts Medical School, the
    Illinois Institute of Technology, the Instituto Venezolano de
    Investigaciones Científicas (Venezuela), and Moscow State University
    (Russia) used x-ray diffraction (XRD) obtained at the BioCAT beamline to
    show that neighboring free and blocked myosin heads on the thick filament
    are arranged in an interacting-heads motif (IHM) within live tarantula
    muscles, supporting previous results obtained by cryogenic electron
    microscopy as seen in Fig. 1. In the case of fully relaxed muscles, there
    is little evidence of myosin phosphorylation before the tetanic contraction.

    To understand the activation of myosin proteins, the researchers monitored
    time-resolved XRD experiments on excised tarantula leg muscles. Results
    indicate that phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC)
    allows the myosin heads to move away from the thick filament and towards
    actin proteins on the thin filament to initiate binding. Blocked myosin
    heads are mono-phosphorylated and slowly move away from the thick filament
    whereas the free myosin heads are bi-phosphorylated and move completely
    away. This mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 2. By the end of the tetanic
    event, urea-glycerol gel electrophoresis and XRD results show a substantial
    increase in mono and bi-phosphorylation levels of the myosin proteins with
    almost no evidence of non-phosphorylated myosin — indicating that
    phosphorylation is the first step in activating the myosin proteins.

    The full relaxation time for tarantula leg muscles can take longer than
    6 minutes depending on the level of phosphorylation. During this process,
    the mono-phosphorylated blocked myosin heads become dephosphorylated and
    return to the thick filament and the fully released bi-phosphorylated myosin
    heads become mono-phosphorylated and slowly dock back to the thick filament.
    Prior to such full relaxation, the myosin heads remain partially
    phosphorylated and away from the thick filament and readily available for
    interaction with actin, making it easier to produce force during a
    post-tetanic twitch. This appears to be the basis of post-tetanic twitch
    potentiation. These results are supported by the decline in PTP over time,
    as the RLC phosphorylation gradually returns to the baseline. Collectively,
    the researchers conclude that the activation and PTP behavior of tarantula
    muscles are consistent with an IHM Cooperative Phosphorylation Activation
    mechanism (Fig. 2).

    Interestingly, the mechanism for myosin activation in tarantulas is
    different than what has been observed in other species. There are examples
    in the literature that show direct binding of calcium ions, mechanosensing,
    or delayed stretch activation as the main activation step for releasing
    myosin so that it can bind with actin on the thin filament to start a
    muscle contraction.

    Evolution has a way of slowly adapting our physiologies to best match our
    environmental conditions. A tarantula, which has a very sedentary lifestyle
    with small bursts of movement for capturing prey, may exhibit different
    muscle physiology than a frog.

    Ultimately, understanding the ways that muscles contract and relax in many
    different species will provide a deeper understanding of how to protect the
    most important muscle in our bodies.
