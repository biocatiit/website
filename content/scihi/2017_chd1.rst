        DNA in eukaryotic cells is normally found associated with protiens called
        histone in particles called nucleosomes linked by short segments of DNA.
        Chromatin remodelers are specialized ATP-dependent molecular machines that
        can reorganize the structure of nucelsomes as needed for such processes
        such as replication, transcription and DNA repair.

        Remodeling results in evenly spaced nucleosomes along the DNA strand
        yet the way remodelers achieve this is not understood. CHD-1 is a
        remodeler important for transcription. Here, the authors show that
        the Chd1 remodeler shifts DNA back and forth by dynamically alternating
        between different segments of the nucleosome. During sliding, Chd1
        generates unstable remodeling intermediates that spontaneously relax
        to a pre-remodeled position. They demonstrate that nucleosome sliding
        is tightly controlled by two regulatory domains: the DNA binding domain,
        which interferes with sliding when its range is limited by a truncated
        linking segment, and the chromodomains, which play a key role in substrate
        discrimination. They propose that active interplay of the ATPase motor
        with the regulatory domains may promote dynamic nucleosome structures
        uniquely suited for histone exchange and chromatin reorganization during
        transcription. This work advances our understanding of the Chd1 chromatin
        remodeler, and puts forward several concepts that may also apply to other
        remodeling enzymes.

        *While most of the study was based on single molecule FRET, high quality
        SEC-SAX at BioCAT played a key role in testing hypothetical configurations
        of mutant proteins generated to test the proposed packing models.*
