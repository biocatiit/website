            Model fitting to SEC-SAXS data using MultiFoXS (yellow model, C)
            suggested that the Sas6T solution structure was largely similar to
            the crystal structure (purple) and there was limited conformational
            flexibility in Sas6T -- supporting the importance of the extensive
            hydrogen bonding network in keeping the domains properly oriented
            with respect to one another.

    The ways in which starches, in particular digestion-resistant starches,
    are accommodated by gut bacteria remains relatively poorly understood at
    the molecular level. Digestion-resistant starches are accessed by
    specialized gut bacteria with specific carbohydrate-binding systems. One
    such system is the Ruminococcus bromii Starch Adherence System member
    6 (Sas6), which consists of two starch-specific carbohydrate-binding
    modules from family 26 (RbCBM26) and family 74 (RbCBM74). The authors
    present a structural and functional characterization by crystallography,
    SAXS, native mass spec and other methods of one such system from
    Ruminococcus bromii (Sas6). The crystal structure of Sas6 showed that
    the RbCBM74 starch-binding groove complements the double helical α-glucan
    geometry of amylopectin, suggesting that this module selects this feature
    in starch granules. The overall structure was compact – both in crystals
    and in solution, as measured by size-exclusion chromatography-coupled
    SAXS (SEC-SAXS) – stabilized by significant hydrogen bonding networks
    between the domains. SEC-SAXS experiments were performed at BioCAT.
    Isothermal titration calorimetry and native mass
    spectrometry demonstrate that RbCBM74 recognizes longer single and
    double helical α-glucans, while RbCBM26 binds short malto-oligosaccharides.
    Bioinformatic analysis supports the conservation of the
    amylopectin-targeting platform in CBM74s from resistant-starch
    degrading bacteria.  Together, these data allowed the authors to
    elucidate the starch granule recognition mechanism, providing foundational
    work for both engineering of starch-degrading systems as well as
    gut-microbiome focused health applications.
