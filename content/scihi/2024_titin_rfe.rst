            Mechanism of RFE. Configuration of sarcomeric proteins during (A)
            IsoS, (B) IsoL, and (C) IsoR  indicating isometric  contractions
            and short length, long length and after an active stretch
            respectively. In passive muscle, titin-thin filament interactions
            are weak so that myofilaments do not show significant strain during
            passive stretch. During contraction, the titin-thin filament
            interaction becomes stronger, so that during an eccentric contraction,
            titin is extended, producing elevated titin-based force and
            explaining the mechanical and structural signatures in IsoR.
            Increased titin-based force contributes to RFE by  decreasing
            smaller lattice spacing and increased thick filament stiffness,
            leading to increased force production and force transmission,
            respectively.

    Residual force enhancement (RFE) is a property of skeletal muscle where
    more force is produced after an active stretch than if it were simply
    activated at the longer length.  This property is important for jumping,
    locomotive, and stabilizing movements of the body. The molecular mechanism
    underlying RFE is not well understood.

    In muscle, the protein titin connects myofilaments and has been shown to
    have many roles in sarcomere stability and modulating contraction.  The
    authors of this study investigated titin's function during contraction using
    small-angle X-ray diffraction of untreated WT mouse skeletal muscle and
    muscle where 50%  of the titin was cleaved. They compared their results to
    those obtained from mdm titin mutant mce that do not show residual force enhancement.

    The authors observed that the sarcomeres in the RFE state show structural
    differences from those during isometric contraction, indicating increased
    thick filament strain and decreased lattice spacing, most likely caused by
    elevated titin-based forces. These structural differences after an active
    stretch were reduced in WT muscle after titin cleavage and absent in mdm
    muscle. The authors concluded that decreased lattice spacing, increased
    thick filament stiffness, and increased non-cross-bridge forces due to
    titin, therefore, are the major contributors to RFE providing a molecular
    explanation for this important physical property of muscle.
