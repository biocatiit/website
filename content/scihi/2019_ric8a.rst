    G-protein signaling has been the dominant theme in the Artemyev lab and
    their recent work specifically addresses Ric8A (Resistance to inhibitors
    of cholinesterase 8A) structure and function. Ric8A is a well-known
    regulator of G-protein biology and belongs to a class of proteins different
    from the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which act via interactions
    with monomeric Gα subunits as opposed to heterotrimeric Gαβγ proteins.
    SAXS was used in combination with crystallography and biochemical studies
    to show that the flexible C-terminal tail is important for the overall
    stability of Ric8A and the function as a guanine nucleotide exchange
    factor (GEF). The crystal structure revealed that Ric8A belongs to a
    functionally diverse class of proteins with what is known as an
    armadillo-fold (ARM) characterized by two layers of alpha helices arranged
    in a right handed superhelix. Ric8A diverged from the class in terms of the
    number of ARM repeats (8 as opposed to 10) and is further followed by a
    flexible region spanning ~ 70 residues.

    Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used to determine that a construct
    without the C-terminal 70 amino acids was significantly less stable which
    suggests that this flexible tail region is involved in intramolecular
    interactions and it may allosterically promote its binding to Gα. Molecular
    dynamics simulations were used to model experimental SAXS data and it was clear
    that an acidic stretch of amino acids from the proximal region of the
    C-terminal tail was involved in an extensive network of stabilizing
    interactions with the core of Ric8A. Using SAXS data obtained from a
    construct containing both the proximal and distal tail regions the distal
    part of the C-terminal tail was shown to have extended conformations and
    to have no interactions with the Ric8A core, while the biochemical studies
    showed that this part of the tail is essential for the complex formation
    with Gα. Information from a variety of complementary biochemical and
    biophysical techniques was instrumental in clarifying the true mechanism
    of Ric8A and in delineating the similarities and differences between
    Ric8A and canonical GPCRs.
