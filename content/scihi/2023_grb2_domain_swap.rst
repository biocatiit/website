            The SH2/SH2 domain-swapped GRB2 dimer matched the experimental
            SAXS data significantly better than other models, providing direct
            structural evidence for this conformation in solution.

    Adaptor proteins are accessories to main proteins in signal transduction
    pathways that usually lack intrinsic enzymatic activity but instead
    facilitate the linking of binding partners together to enable the
    formation of larger signaling complexes. One widely expressed adaptor
    protein is the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), which
    facilitates formation of cytoplasmic signaling complexes from a wide
    array of binding partners, including (among others) growth factor
    receptors, cytokine receptors and T cell receptor (TCR) Î¶ chains. As a
    consequence, the structure and function of GRB2 have become major areas
    of investigation for novel areas of interventions against various human
    diseases.  GRB2 has been shown to exist in either a monomeric or dimeric
    state, where GRB2 dimers are formed by the exchange of protein segments
    between domains, a process termed "domain-swapping".  Prior to this work,
    swapping between the SH2 and SH3 domains of GRB2 has been demonstrated in
    the full-length structure, but SH2/SH2 domain-swapping had not. Researchers
    at the University of Iowa generated a model of full-length GRB2 dimer
    with an SH2/SH2 domain-swapped conformation, and proceeded to validate
    the model in solution using SEC-MALS-SAXS experiments at BioCAT. They were
    able to further validated their model with GRB2 mutants that favored
    either a monomeric or a dimeric state through mutations within the SH2
    domain that either forbid or promote SH2/SH2 domain-swapping. Together
    with knockdown and re-expression studies, the authors showed that a novel
    dimeric GRB2 conformation with domain-swapping between SH2 domains and
    monomer/dimer transitions are critical for GRB2 to facilitate early
    signaling complexes in human T cells.
