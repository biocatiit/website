When combinatorial chemistry produces new varieties of reagents, the
tricky next step is figuring out whether those molecules will be
biochemically active. While there are several methods for finding active
molecules, they all have limitations. Researchers from Argonne National
Laboratory, using the BioCAT beamline 18-ID, employed wide-angle x-ray
scattering (WAXS) to develop a method for identifying drug candidates.

One way to identify active molecules is to design an assay for
the desired function of a protein target and then test each small
molecule variant. This approach is labor intensive and time consuming
because it means that a different assay must be developed for
each drug target of interest. Another approach is based on
deriving a more general probe that would identify whether any protein
structural change had occurred. A large number of samples could be
screened in this way; those that showed promise could then be
examined more closely for mechanistic details. Just such a
general method, which uses x-ray scattering to detect functional
drug candidates, is now available.

The APS served as a unique resource to aid the investigators in their study of
WAXS of proteins in solution. The researchers are developing WAXS as a probe
for detecting the structural changes that usually occur when a protein binds
to a functional ligand. Such activity encompasses a broad range of changes in
secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of the protein. Although nuclear
magnetic resonance can be used to characterize proteins in solution, this
method requires extensive data collection and analyses. Small-angle x-ray scattering
(SAXS) allows researchers to observe changes in the radius of gyration, but
not all domain rotations and none of the small side-chain interactions.
Using the WAXS technique, data can be collected quickly and accurately using
label free ligands and targets, making the method well suited to moderate-throughput
detection and analysis of protein-ligand interactions. The data collected
permits direct estimate of the magnitude of the structural change, without reference
to crystallographic coordinates. Although the exact form of the structural
change at atomic resolution cannot be inferred from WAXS, both the magnitude
and the class of the change can be elucidated. Even without crystallographic
data, a combination of SAXS and WAXS has the potential to characterize what
happens during ligand binding. As proof of concept, the data demonstrate that
WAXS is a sensitive probe for identifying functional ligands through ligand-induced
structural changes.

Using proteins in solution, five classes of structural change were studied:
transferrin for ligand-induced domain rotation, maltose binding protein for
hinge-bending motion, alcohol dehydrogenase for change of the shape of the
binding cleft, calmodulin for ligand-induced refolding, and adipocyte lipid
binding protein and ricin for side chain reorientations. To minimize damage
to the proteins, thin aluminum foils were used as x-ray beam attenuators to
control the incident beam flux. Protein concentrations ranged between 12.6 and
48 mg/mL. As a validation, the program CRYSOL was used to predict WAXS patterns
from the proteins, using the atomic coordinates from the crystallographic
structures.

The data showed that ligand-induced structural changes involving domain
movements, as well as smaller ones (such as side chain rearrangements) are
detected by WAXS, an in vitro biophysical probe. For the most part, measured
scattering was in agreement with that predicted by applying the CRYSOL software
to the atomic coordinates (Fig. 1). Ligand-induced domain movements, however,
were larger than predicted on the basis of x-ray crystallography alone, consistent
with a previous finding that crystal-lattice domain positions may differ from those
observed in solution (Fig. 2).

When binding a ligand, most proteins undergo some change in conformation, either
local or global. Collecting the necessary WAXS data to characterize these changes
takes about 30 s at a third-generation synchrotron source and can be carried
out with a wide range of solution conditions for protein-ligand pairs, which
do not have to be chemically modified. As such, WAXS can greatly improve the
speed and accuracy with which drug candidates can be assessed for their therapeutic
potential, enhancing the drug development process.
