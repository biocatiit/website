    Cellular communication mediated by a variety of cell-surface receptors
    involves ligand induced conformational changes in the extracellular
    region (ECR). A variety of drugs such as cetuximab (Epidermal Growth
    Factor Receptor), etrolizumab (Integrins), and erenumab (calcitonin
    receptor-like receptor) function by trapping ECRs in specific conformations
    and have proved to be effective therapeutic agents in several cancers,
    bowel diseases, and migraine. Leon et al., have addressed a class of
    relatively understudied G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs) called
    adhesion-GPCRs (aGPCRs) which have a structurally unique ECR with a
    diverse set of mechanistic possibilities. Specifically, they study the
    Gpr126, which is known to be essential for Schwann cell myelination,
    involved in heart development in the mouse model, and inner ear development
    in Zebra fish.  Determination of the high-resolution structure of the
    Zebra fish Gpr126 ECR revealed the involvement of a heretofore undefined
    domain that has splice variants with or without a 23aa stretch in different
    isotypes (-ss or +ss) and is the primary determinant of whether the ECR is
    in the open active state or the closed inactive state. Also remarkable was
    the calcium dependent site at the tip of the ECR which promoted the closed
    inactive state of Gpr126. The closed conformation observed in the
    crystallization studies was confirmed using a combination of negative
    staining EM and SAXS. SEC-SAXS performed at BioCAT showed that the radius
    of gyration (Rg) of the crystallization construct was ~42 Å as opposed
    to ~ 52 Å characteristic of the open conformation. Negative stain EM 2D
    class averages for the +ss isoform showed a much higher degree of
    conformational diversity compared to the -ss construct, a significant
    fraction of which were in open conformations strongly suggestive of the
    role of the 23aa insertion in destabilizing the closed conformation. Rg
    values obtained using SAXS with the +ss constructs were predictably larger
    than that for the -ss construct and elution volumes in size-exclusion
    chromatography also strongly suggest a more extended conformation for
    the +ss construct. Furthermore, measuring cAMP levels which is a byproduct
    of a well-known G protein signaling assay showed that the +ss construct
    does indeed have measurably higher activity than the -ss isotype. Leon et
    al have used a multi-technique approach to showcase the structure based
    mechanistic complexity involved in the aGPCR ECRs, which presents them as
    drug targets with immense potential.
