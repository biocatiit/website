            The unfolded-state ensemble (USE) undergoes a continuous
            reduction in chain dimensions as a function of decreased
            denaturant concentration.

    While there is emerging consensus in the protein folding community
    concerning the behavior of proteins under unfolding conditions, the
    occurrence of unfolded states under physiological (native) conditions
    and their propensity to aggregate are the basis of several human
    pathologies. Valuable insights into these transient species were obtained
    by taking advantage of the temporal resolution afforded by combining
    time-resolved fluorescence and continuous (in this case chaotic) flow
    SAXS (CF-SAXS) with all atom simulations and polymer theory. A group of
    researchers led by the Raleigh lab (Stony Brook University) used the 59
    amino acid N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 (NTL9), which has
    a well-studied two state folding mechanism. By introducing FRET pairs
    several pairwise distance distributions were measured in the unfolded and
    native conditions in equilibrium and also the unfolded states in native
    conditions using a continuous flow mixer Interestingly chain contraction
    as indicated by fluorescence decay was observed well within the dead time
    of the mixer (~40 µs) showing that chain collapse happens considerably
    faster than the time-scale required for completion of the folding
    process (2.5 ms for NTL9).  While FRET reports on local interactions, SAXS
    reports on global shape changes so the two techniques are highly
    complementary.  Data were obtained using SAXS in both equilibrium SAXS and
    continuous flow time-resolved modes. While the Rgs for the unfolded state
    at 10 M urea and fully folded state at 1 M urea were determined to be ~ 24 Å
    and ~ 13 Å respectively using equilibrium measurements, the Rg of the
    unfolded state at 1 M urea was found to be ~19 Å which represented an
    approximately 20% contraction. Atomic level information about the different
    folding states studied using FRET and SAXS was provided by all atom
    simulations, which, unlike coarse grained models, are able to study
    sequence-specific interactions and side-chain-specific backbone conformational
    preferences. These simulations, while confirming the findings from their
    low-resolution technical counterparts also showed that the contracted but
    as yet unfolded state of NTL9 found in native conditions is characterized
    by a mixture of several native-like and nonnative structural features. A
    novel combination of experimental and theoretical techniques proved to be
    a powerful tool to explore the always intriguing process of protein folding
    in increasingly fine detail.
