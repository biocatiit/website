    Right ventricular (RV) contractile dysfunction commonly occurs and worsens
    outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and
    pulmonary hypertension (HFrEF-PH). However, such dysfunction often goes
    undetected by standard clinical RV indices, raising concerns that they may
    not reflect aspects of underlying myocyte dysfunction. To address the need
    for better diagnostics, the authors sought to characterize RV myocyte
    contractile depression in HFrEF-PH, identify those components reflected
    by clinical RV indices, and uncover underlying biophysical mechanisms.

    X-ray diffraction and myosin ATP turnover quantification assays show that
    patients with HFrEF-PH RV dysfunction with depressed isometric tension
    have reduced on state and disordered-relaxed (DRX) myosin; moreover,
    increasing the proportion of DRX myosin rescues the RV failure myocyte
    phenotype, whereas depressing DRX induces it. These results show, for
    the first time, that reduced basal DRX (on state) myosin contributes to
    a heart failure phenotype. HFrEF-PH RV myocytes exhibit blunted
    stretch-mediated recruitment of myosin from its super-relaxed to its
    DRX state, in association with depressed length-dependent active
    stiffness, a key contributor to Frank-Starling reserve. Although there
    are many RV myocyte contractile deficits in HFrEF-PH, commonly used
    clinical indices only detect reduced isometric calcium-stimulated force,
    which is related to deficits in basal and recruitable %DRX myosin. Our
    results support use of therapies to increase %DRX and enhance
    length-dependent recruitment of DRX myosin heads in such patients. Direct
    sarcomere-acting drugs that augment the basal proportion of DRX myosin or
    improve the recruitment of DRX myosin under loaded stressed states should
    help restore RV contractile reserve in these patients.
