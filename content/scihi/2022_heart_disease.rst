            Mechanism of action for HCM-D166V and DCM-D94A mutations.
            The HCM-D166V model disrupts the SRX state and promotes the
            SRX-to-DRX transition increasing the number of DRX heads and
            leading to hypercontractile behavior. The DCM-D94A model stabilizes
            the SRX state yielding fewer heads available for contraction and
            leading to clinical hypocontractility. Abbreviations: ELC, myosin
            essential light chain; RLC, regulatory light chain; DRX, disordered
            relaxed; SRX, super-relaxed.

    Cardiomyopathies are diseases of the heart muscle in which the muscle of
    the pumping chamber (ventricle) can become enlarged (dilated cardiomyopathy;
    DCM) or thickened (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HCM), potentially leading
    to heart failure. There are currently no effective treatments but the disease
    often has a genetic component related to mutations in the heart muscle
    proteins that are involved in muscle contraction, so some researchers have
    focused their therapeutic development efforts on correcting these muscle
    contraction problems based on the structural basis of the defect. A recent
    study from a team of researchers using the U.S. Department of Energy’s
    Advanced Photon Source (APS) employed humanized mouse models expressing
    mutations observed in patients with HCM and DCM to evaluate the
    structure-function relationships and the changes observed in cardiac
    muscle contraction with these mutations. The work, published in the
    Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
    America, provides a deeper understanding of the effects of
    cardiomyopathy-causing gene mutations on heart muscle contraction that
    could lead to the development of new therapies for this potentially
    life-threatening disease.

    About 70% of patients with inherited HCM have a defect in the gene for
    the cardiac myosin protein or the cardiac myosin binding protein C. However,
    recent genetic evidence has suggested that mutations in the cardiac
    regulatory light chain (RLC) MYL2 gene are more common than previously
    thought and can be associated with poor outcomes. In order to understand
    the structural basis for how mutations in the MYL2 gene can cause HCM, or
    the less commonly occurring DCM, the research team performed muscle
    structure and force measurement experiments on heart muscle samples from
    mice that express mutated human RLC proteins, the HCM-D166V mutation
    associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or the DCM-D94A mutation
    associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.

    Normally, the cardiac regulatory light chain protein acts as a major
    subunit of the cardiac myosin protein to regulate calcium-mediated
    interactions with other muscle proteins and the myosin movements that
    result in the power stroke of muscle contraction. On this basis, the team
    set out to understand the relationship between these two mutations in the
    MYL2 gene and associated defects in the function of RLC in cardiomyopathy.

    They used the small-angle x-ray diffraction technique at the Biophysics
    Collaborative Access Team 18-ID x-ray beamline at the APS to compare the
    spatial orientation of the thick and thin muscle filaments in left
    ventricular papillary muscle (LVPM) from mice expressing the mutated
    human RLC to mice expressing the normal, unmutated wildtype human cardiac
    RLC. (The APS is an Office of Science user facility at Argonne National
    Laboratory.)

    In this model system, small-angle x-ray diffraction can measure
    interfilament lattice spacing that is proportional to the distance between
    two adjacent muscle filaments and equatorial intensity ratios that provide
    information about the number of myosin heads that are attached to
    actin-containing thin filaments (cross-bridges). By comparing structural
    results at different concentrations of calcium and simultaneously recording
    force traces, they were able to get structure-function information for all
    three muscle types. The intensity ratios at different calcium concentrations
    showed that contraction of the HCM mutant muscles were the most sensitive
    to calcium, forming more cross-bridges at submaximal calcium concentrations
    than either the DCM mutant or the wildtype muscle.

    The HCM and DCM mutations also seem to affect the super-relaxed (SRX)
    state of myosin and the equilibrium between the SRX and the disordered
    relaxed state (DRX), SRX ↔ DRX, differently. The super-relaxed state is
    an energy-conserving state of relaxed muscle myosin that uses lower levels
    of ATP. Fluorescent nucleotide exchange experiments on the different mouse
    LVPM fibers showed that the HCM mutation destabilizes the energy-conserving
    SRX state and promotes the DRX state, leading to the hypercontractile
    behavior that was also observed in the X-ray diffraction experiments.
    Conversely, the DCM mutation actually favors the SRX, consistent with
    hypocontractile cross-bridge behavior observed with DCM (Fig. 1).

    These results provide structural information about how these mutations
    manifest as the heart muscle problems observed in cardiomyopathy. The HCM
    mutation causes the protein to be more sensitive to calcium, to have higher
    levels of cross-bridge formation, and to be less often in the super-relaxed
    state, all consistent with the features of hypercontractility observed in
    HCM patients. The DCM mutation didn’t exhibit changes in calcium sensitivity
    but was more often in the super-relaxed state, consistent with the low
    ejection fraction dysfunction observed in DCM patients.

    Understanding the structural basis for these RLC mutations may be the first
    step in the design of treatments that can correct the problems associated
    with these cardiomyopathy mutations.
