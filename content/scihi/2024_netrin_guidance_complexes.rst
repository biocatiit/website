                Negative stain electron microscopy and SAXS results demonstrated
                the UNC-6–heparin–UNC-5 complexes have stable, ordered architectures.

    Netrins are a conserved class of proteins involved in synaptic connectivity
    of the nervous system in bilaterian animals. They act as secreted guidance
    cues, with the unique ability to exert repulsive and attractive responses
    on growing axons. They are also known to be involved in cell proliferation,
    migration and differentiation, and are therefore targets for treating
    cancer and insulin resistance. During axon growth and cell migration, the
    presence of the receptor Uncoordinated-5 (UNC-5) on target cells results
    in repulsion. However, the exact mechanism involved in the induction of
    repulsive forces has been relatively unknown due to the lack of biochemical
    and structural information about these systems. Researchers at the
    University of Chicago and Stanford University, in collaboration with BioCAT
    staff, showed that UNC-5 is a heparin-binding protein, determined its
    structure bound to a heparin fragment, and could modulate UNC-5–heparin
    affinity using a directed evolution platform or structure-based rational
    design.

    A question they needed to answer was whether the heparin + UNC-6–mediated
    UNC-5 oligomers are an ordered and well-defined molecular species or (ii)
    whether these oligomers are simply a result of UNC-6 and UNC-5 decorating
    the long, linear heparin chains. They used negative-staining electron
    microscopy, multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and small-angle x-ray
    scattering (SAXS) to visualize the UNC-5–heparin–UNC-6 complex. The EM
    images and class averages consistently show a large, globular complex as
    opposed to long or thin chains, a description consistent with models from
    the SAXS data where the pair distribution [P(r)] plot and molecular shape
    analysis both indicate a strongly globular complex. Given the multi-domain
    nature of the system and the flexibility of the UNC-5 ectodomain, this was
    not expected and indicates that the UNC-6–heparin–UNC-5 complex has a
    relatively defined structure with ordered geometry, which may represent
    a signaling-competent conformation on the cell surface.

    The work presented here establishes a structural and molecular model that
    provides context for much of the existing netrin literature, and may serve
    as a stepping-stone toward an atomic-resolution structure of the complete
    complex.
