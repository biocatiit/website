                flight muscle. (Pink and blue numbers represent spacings between
                repeating structural elements as calculated from the pattern.) Top
                right: Structure (left) of the modeled myosin heads (pink/white/green)
                in their relaxed, pre-powerstroke state and (right) in their "rigor" or
                post-powerstroke state. Bottom: Transition from the head shape in
                relaxed insect muscle (blue) to rigor-like final shape (green), showing
                the pivots needed (red on thick filament, white within head) to let the
                neck swing from one form to the other when bound to actin.

        Researchers have achieved the first detailed view of
        resting muscle filaments poised to contract, a long
        sought window into the biochemical cycle that
        causes muscle contraction. The group determined the overall
        structure of insect muscle fibers from x-ray diffraction patterns
        and performed computer modeling to analyze the data. The
        resulting structure, reported in August 2003, suggests a specific
        mechanism for insect muscle activation.

        Muscle cells (fibers) contain two parallel, overlapping sets
        of protein filaments, made of myosin and actin, respectively,
        that align with the direction of contraction. The myosin and actin
        filaments have fixed length individually, but they slide past each
        other like telescope segments to stretch or shorten the overall
        muscle. The shortening motion is driven by comma-shaped
        myosin "heads," which radiate out from the myosin filaments
        and cyclically bind to, bend against, and then release adjacent
        actin filaments. The bind-and-bend phase of each cycle is
        called a powerstroke. Comparing bound and resting head structures
        and positions can help researchers deduce the powerstroke
        mechanism. Researchers had previously viewed the end
        state of the powerstroke, in which myosin heads have bent and
        are strongly bound to actin (Fig. 1). No one had reported the
        orientation of the unbound heads in myosin's relaxed initial
        state until August 2003, however.

        Researchers from Imperial College London, Duke
        University, and the Illinois Institute of Technology decided that
        improved synchrotron technologies and data analysis tools
        offered the prospect of modeling the relaxed structure. They
        recorded so-called low-angle x-ray diffraction patterns from
        flight muscle fibers of giant waterbugs on the BioCAT beamline
        18-ID at the APS, which gave them new and sharper details of
        the large-scale myosin filament structure. A single recording
        cannot produce both large- and fine-scale data because large
        structural elements are encoded in low-angle features of the diffraction
        pattern and vice versa; cameras can resolve one or the
        other, but not both. So the group computed thousands of different
        ways of fitting existing high-resolution atomic models of
        head structure into the overall model, on the basis of the
        assumption that each head could pivot at two points, and identified
        the best fit to the observed low-angle x-ray pattern. The
        model confirmed that resting myosin filaments have stacked
        rings or "crowns" of eight heads each — two heads per myosin
        molecule. One head of each myosin projects about 90° from the
        filament axis; the other tucks inward against the filament's circumference.

        Comparing the results of modeling against actual post-powerstroke
        myosin head conformations in waterbug and many
        other species suggests the changes that take place during a
        powerstroke cycle (Fig. 1). Each of the four projecting heads
        rotates slightly about the "neck," which connects to a pivot on
        the myosin filament. The rotation positions the head to bind
        tightly to the actin filament and tilt forcefully by 45° relative
        to the axis of the filament. Such a powerstroke would move the head and
        bound actin filament 10 nanometers down the axis. The four
        inward-pointing heads each touch an adjacent projecting head.
        These contacts may restrain both myosin heads from cleaving
        high-energy ATP molecules—the powerstroke fuel—until the right
        moment.

        Insect flight muscles must contract rapidly and precisely to
        keep the insect aloft. As if optimized to do so, the relaxed outward
        myosin heads seem poised to bind actin and begin powerstroking.
        The researchers speculate that the increased calcium in stimulated
        muscle cells may loosen the heads and modify actin filaments to
        facilitate binding. Stretching flight muscle triggers concerted powerstrokes,
        perhaps by perturbing the ring of contacts between
        inward and outward heads to fully enable ATP splitting and actin
        binding.
