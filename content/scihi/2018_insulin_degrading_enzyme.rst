    The Tang lab (University of Chicago, Illinois) has a deep interest in the
    structure and function of Insulin Degrading Enzyme (IDE), a zinc
    metalloprotease with a role in insulin and amyloid β degradation and known
    to be a significant factor in the pathophysiology of conditions such as
    Diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer’s disease. Previous structural studies
    showed that IDE forms dimers that can assume two distinct and functionally
    significant conformations. Substrate recognition occurs in an enclosed
    catalytic site formed by the dimerized IDE mostly via electrostatic
    interactions and size and shape complementarity. Catalytically important
    open conformations have been difficult to study using crystallography. The
    Tang lab used a combination of cryoEM, X-ray crystallography,
    Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange coupled Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS), and SAXS
    to elucidate key mechanistic details. Four heretofore unknown and distinct
    conformations were determined using cryoEM strongly suggesting that
    substrate recognition and capture are contingent on the openness of IDE
    conformation.

    Equilibrium SAXS showed that while IDE dimers exist in equilibrium between
    open and closed conformations, the presence of substrate conformationally
    restricts IDE to the partially closed or closed state. The question
    therefore was whether the enzymatic rate of ~ 2 per second determined by
    enzyme kinetic analysis was attributable to the rate of conformational
    opening and closing of IDE. BioCAT has been a pioneer in the development of
    microfluidic mixers usable for time-resolved SAXS measurements. One such
    development is the laminar flow mixer which provides access to time-regimes
    in the millisecond to several seconds. The change in conformation from open
    to closed is represented by a significant difference in the radius of
    gyration (Rg)(Fig.8). Fast mixing with insulin and monitoring the change in
    Rg showed that the rate of transition from high to low Rg was compatible
    with the aforementioned catalytic rate of ~ 2 per second (Fig.9). This
    project is an illustration of SAXS’s place in scenarios where a
    multidisciplinary approach is mandated by the complexity of questions
    that cannot be conclusively answered using any one technique.
