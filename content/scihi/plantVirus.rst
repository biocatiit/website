        Amy Kendall (left), Michele
        McDonald, and Sarah Tiggelaar—all
        with the Stubbs Lab in the Department
        of Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt
        University—taking data at the Bio-CAT
        18-ID beamline.

        Kendall: “Our lab uses fiber diffraction
        data from oriented sols and dried
        fibers to determine the structures of
        flexible filamentous plant viruses. Our
        long-term goal is to produce atomic
        models based on diffraction data at
        resolutions close to 3 Å, but a great
        deal of information can be obtained
        at lower resolution, including the size,
        shape, and symmetry of the viruses.

        “These viruses are of great significance
        as models for fundamental
        virology and cell biology, They have
        enormous potential as vectors in
        biotechnology and they are of considerable
        importance because of the
        damage they cause to agriculture.
        We also use the filamentous plant
        viruses as important model systems for
        developments in fiber diffraction.”
