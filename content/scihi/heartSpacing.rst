        The heart regulates ventricular output in response to
        changes in ventricular filling, a mechanism known as FrankStarling’s
        law of the heart. Part of the cellular basis for the law
        is an increase in myofilament Ca2+ responsiveness upon an
        increase in sarcomere length (SL). (Sarcomeres are the basic
        functional units of muscle fibers, which contract in response to
        calcium influx.) How information on SL is transmitted to myofilaments
        is unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that a
        decrease in myofilament lattice spacing (LS) in response to an
        increase in SL underlies the Ca2+ sensitivity.

        In support of this hypothesis, shrinkage of the myofilament
        lattice by osmotic compression using high-molecular-weight
        moieties has been shown to increase myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity
        at a short SL, mimicking the effect of increased SL. The
        extent of LS shrinkage in that experiment was estimated from
        the reduction in muscle width, however. Recently, researchers
        directly measured LS by synchrotron x-ray diffraction as a function
        of SL in skinned rat cardiac trabeculae bathed in 0-6%
        dextran (high-molecular-weight) solutions.

        To assess the effect of SL on myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity,
        Ca2+-contraction force relationships were determined at three
        SLs (1.95, 2.10, and 2.25 μm) in each group studied (0%, 3%,
        and 6% dextran solution). Increasing SL caused a leftward shift
        of the force relationship. Although application of dextran
        caused a general increase in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity at
        each SL, the length-dependent shift of the force relationship did
        not seem altered by dextran treatment.

        Researchers simultaneously measured myofilament LS
        and SL by using synchrotron x-ray diffraction at the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team beamline 18-ID. Increasing dextran
        concentration modified the diffraction pattern of individual samples
        in a way indicative of a reduction in LS. However, LS
        became a less sensitive function of SL with increasing amounts
        of dextran in solution. These results indicate that the impact of
        interfilament spacing on myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is not constant
        but rather varies with the overall compression state of the
        sarcomere.

        Under the current conditions, application of 3% dextran
        compressed the myofilament lattice beyond that observed at
        even the largest SL under control conditions. Therefore,
        skinned trabeculae were treated with 1% dextran to osmotically
        compress the myofilament lattice at a short SL to match that of
        the uncompressed control sample at a longer SL. Application of
        1% dextran to a 2.02-μm-SL sample did not significantly alter
        Ca2+ sensitivity, despite the reduction in myofilament LS.

        If interfilament spacing were the molecular length sensor,
        one would expect the reduction in length dependence of myofilament
        LS to lead to a reduction of the length dependence of
        myofilament activation. Osmotic compression in this study,
        however, did not affect the length dependence of myofilament
        Ca2+ sensitivity. The precise reason for the discrepancies
        between previous studies and the current study is unclear.

        tween previous studies and the current study is unclear.
        Our data suggest that, at a minimum, the interfilament
        spacing theory must be amended to include a variable impact of
        myofilament LS on Ca2+ sensitivity, depending on the overall
        extent of LS compression. At 6% dextran, LS reduction relative
        to that at 3% dextran was not matched by a further increase in
        Ca2+ sensitivity, in contradiction to the theory. The relationship
        between interfilament spacing and Ca2+ sensitivity may therefore
        be highly nonlinear. However, the 1% dextran test indicates
        that changes in LS per se are not responsible for increased Ca2+
        sensitivity. If they were, the moderately compressed trabeculae at
        short SL should have
        behaved similarly to
        uncompressed trabeculae
        at long SL, given the
        equivalent LS.
