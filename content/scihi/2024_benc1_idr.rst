            EOM Analysis of SEC-SAXS data supports the observation that Zn\ :sup:`2+`
            increases compaction of the IDR

    Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that degrades
    un-needed cellular components such as misfolded, aggregated, mutated
    and damaged proteins, organelles, and pathogens. Autophagy dysfunction
    is implicated in numerous diseases including neurodegenerative disorders,
    muscular diseases, cardiomyopathy, cancer and infectious diseases. Many
    proteins involved in autophagy contain intrinsically disordered regions
    (IDRs) that do not form stable secondary or tertiary structure. The
    structural flexibility of IDRs is thought to enable diverse and multiple
    interactions enabling them to regulate cell signaling pathways. Many
    IDRs have been shown to fold upon binding to ligands. BECN1, a key
    autophagy protein involved in autophagosome nucleation, contains two
    invariant CxxC motifs within a large BECN1 intrinsically disordered
    region (IDR) at the BECN1 N-terminus. The goal of the research was to
    uncover the functional roles of the invariant CxxC motifs which were
    hitherto not understood. The authors used inductively coupled plasma mass
    spectrometry to demonstrate that BECN1 binds Zn\ :sup:`2+` in a 1:1 molar
    ratio, and that mutation of the invariant cysteines prevents co-ordination
    of Zn\ :sup:`2+`, demonstrating that the CxxC motifs are responsible for
    binding Zn\ :sup:`2+`. Zn\ :sup:`2+`-binding increases IDR helicity, as
    demonstrated by circular dichroism, and likely also binding-associated
    helical transitions. SEC-MALS-SAXS at BioCAT was used to show that
    Zn\ :sup:`2+`-binding makes the BECN1 IDR more compact, isothermal
    titration calorimetry to show that the BECN1 IDR does not self-associate,
    and HDX-MS to show that the Zn\ :sup:`2+`-bound state of the IDR has
    reduced solvent accessibility.  They were also able to demonstrate that
    both CxxC motifs are required, but the intervening IDR is less important,
    for starvation-triggered upregulation of autophagy.  These results suggest
    that Zn\ :sup:`2+`-binding via the CxxC motifs is important for helical
    conformational transitions of BECN1 in regulating BECN1-mediated autophagy.
