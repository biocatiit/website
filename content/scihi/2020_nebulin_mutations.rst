            Compound nebulin mutations cause changes in thin filament structure.

.. row::

    Nebulin is a giant protein that winds around the actin filaments in the
    sarcomeres of skeletal muscle.  Mutations in the nebulin gene (NEB) cause
    typical nemaline myopathy (NM), a muscle disorder characterized by muscle
    weakness that are difficult to treat.  Here, the authors of this study
    created a mouse model that mimics the typical nebulin-based NM patient
    with compound-heterozygous mutations.

    Functional, structural, and biochemical studies revealed altered thin
    filament structure, increased myofilament lattice spacing, a reduced
    myofibrillar fractional area, and reduced force production. In particular,
    X-ray diffraction studies on the BioCAT beamline 18ID revealed that the
    actin filament is twisted with a larger radius, that tropomyosin and
    troponin behavior is altered, and that the myofilament spacing is increased
    providing a structural explanation for muscle weakness. This new Compound-Het
    mouse model will be useful for testing experimental therapies for typical NM.
