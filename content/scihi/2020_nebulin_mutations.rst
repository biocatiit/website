    The gene NEB encodes for the skeletal muscle protein nebulin. Mutations in NEB
    cause the disease nemaline myopathy, which is one of the more common inherited
    myopathies. Patients with this muscle disorder have muscle weakness in
    multiple different parts of their body and can also experience difficulties with feeding
    or breathing. Currently, there is no cure for nemaline myopathy and treatment options
    are limited. Therefore, there is a need to better understand this disease and design
    new therapeutics that can improve patient quality of life. A team of researchers from
    the University of Arizona working to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this
    skeletal muscle disorder, report a new mouse model of nemaline myopathy that exhibits
    similar symptoms to those identified in human patients. An important part of this work
    utilized x-ray diffraction data collected at the APS. The diffraction data provide new
    insights into how mutations of NEB alter the molecular structure of skeletal muscles. The
    findings from the study are highly impactful because they significantly increase our
    understanding of how mutations in the gene NEB cause nemaline myopathy. Importantly,
    the new mouse model of this disease can be used to test future therapeutics. Future
    studies are warranted to determine if interventions can relieve disease symptoms in
    these mice. If successful, such therapeutics could be used for improving the quality of
    life in human patients.

    Nemaline myopathy is a rare muscle disease that can be caused by mutations in the gene
    NEB. Over 240 different disease-causing mutations in NEB have been identified in conjunction
    with nemaline myopathy, with the majority of patients having two different mutations in the
    gene NEB. Patients experience symptoms ranging from muscle weakness in the arms, legs,
    face, and neck to difficulties with feeding or breathing. Despite these serious symptoms, there
    is currently no cure and the available treatment options are limited.

    From a functional standpoint, NEB encodes for the protein Nebulin, which is found in the
    sarcomere of skeletal muscle. Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle which undergo involuntary
    muscle contractions, skeletal muscles are under voluntary control and are responsible for
    carrying out bodily movements. For example, someone performing bicep curls in the gym is
    actively controlling and exercising their biceps using skeletal muscles.

    To gain more insight into the molecular structures and mechanisms underlying the disease
    nemaline myopathy, the researchers from the University of Arizona developed a novel animal
    model to study this skeletal muscle disorder. To do this, they created genetically modified mice
    harboring two different mutations in NEB. One of these mutations is a missense
    mutation (resulting in a single amino acid change) and the other mutation is a
    deletion mutation (meaning that a portion of the gene has been removed). The
    result of these two mutations is a class of genetically modified mice that
    exhibit similar symptoms as humans with nemaline myopathy. These genetically
    modified mice also weighed less and have a shorter tibia bone compared to
    genetically normal controls.

    Using the new mouse model, the team examined how these two mutations impacted the
    structure of the muscle on a molecular level. A key part of this work was performed in
    collaboration with scientists at BioCAT. X-ray diffraction patterns collected at
    BioCAT were used to identify molecular structures altered in the mice (Fig. 1).
    The research team found that the sarcomeres in the new strain of genetically
    modified mice were disorganized. One prominent finding was that actin
    filaments ― which play an important role in muscle contraction ― were twisted
    and have a larger radius when compared to the control.
