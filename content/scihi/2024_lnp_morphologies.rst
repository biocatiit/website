The success of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has brought increased attention to
lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as an RNA therapeutic delivery method. One of the
main challenges of LNPs as a delivery method remains the significant percentage
of unloaded LNPs in most (if not all) RNA-LNP formulations, highlighting a
need for better characterization of their formation, composition and morphology.
While there have been a number of recent advances in understanding the formation
and structure of LNPs, studies exploring the influence of non-mRNA RNAs on LNP
morphology remain limited. Of particular interest is the delivery of
self-amplifying mRNA (SAM), which has the potential to both significantly
lower dosage as well extend the antigen expression lifetime in the body.
However, given that SAM molecules are typically significantly larger than
conventional nonreplicating mRNA, and that larger nucleic acids are known to
promote the formation of significant populations of empty LNPs, further work
is needed to better understand the formation, composition and morphology of
LNPs in order to better inform LNPs as a delivery system for promising
therapeutic strategies that rely on larger nucleic acids.

Researchers from ORNL, NIST and the GSK Center for Vaccine research
characterized the morphology of LNPs encapsulating SAMs using a variety of
techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy, contrast-varying small-angle
neutron scattering (CV-SANS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Using
SAXS data collected at BioCAT, the authors studied the global structure of
SAM before and after LNP encapsulation. The pair density distribution
functions [P(r)] clearly show that the SAM LNP systems were significantly
smaller than free SAM, suggesting that the SAM must compact in order to be
loaded into the LNP. Additional cryo-EM experiments showed that SAM LNPs adopt
a wide range of sizes and morphologies, including nonspherical and two-compartment
morphologies. Finally, by formulating SAM LNPs with distinct isotopic
compositions, the authors were able to use CV-SANS to assess the distribution
of helper lipids and apply scattering analysis to the SAXS and SANS data to
determine that the primary representative morphology of SAM LNPs is in fact
nonspherical and asymmetric in its component distribution.

The prevalence of nonspherical morphologies in SAM LNPs is distinct from the
more spherical, uniform morphologies seen in siRNA LNPs and is instead more
similar to those seen with mRNA. Analysis of their composition indicated that
DSPC and PEGylated lipids are common in the outer shell, potentially providing
a starting point for varying the particle size and distribution by changing the
composition of those helper lipids. This work presents the first model of an
RNA-LNP with a nonspherical shape, highlighting the need to explore further
the morphological characteristics of RNA-LNPs. In addition to its clear
practical applications in medicine, this work is also an excellent example
of the strengths of combining SAXS and SANS data, as the techniques excel at
highlighting different components of the SAM LNPs. Nucleic acids are highly
visible in SAXS due to the high contrast27, while lipids have notably better
contrast in SANS. Similarly to their use as validation of high-resolution
macromolecular data, both techniques also provide important validation for
the morphologies observed in the cryo-EM experiments. Given how rapidly the
field is evolving, we expect significant continued interest in scattering
studies of LNP formation, composition and morphologies going forward.

This experiment took particular advantage of the extremely low minimum q
routinely offered at BioCAT. In order to measure the large maximum dimension
of these objects a minimum q of less than 0.0032 Å-1 was required, which is
not routinely available at any other U.S. bioSAXS beamline. The growing
interest by users in using SAXS to characterize LNPs motived BioCAT to acquire
our flow field fractionation instrument to allow in-line size separated
measurements on these systems.
