Nucleosomes are protein–DNA structures which eukaryotic organisms use to package
and organize DNA inside the nucleus. Nucleosomes need to be disassembled to permit
transcription of DNA and reassembled afterwards, hence are an important component of
the gene regulation machinery. The nucleosome core particle (NCP) consists of DNA
wound around a core of eight histone proteins including two dimers of H2A–H2B
histones and an (H3–H4) tetramer that is assembled as a dimer of dimers. A team led by
Lois Pollack at Cornell University used time-resolved SAXS at the BioCAT beamline
18ID at Advanced Photon Source and TR-FRET, in collaboration with Lisa Gloss, at
Washington State University to study changes in the DNA conformations as a function of
the composition of the histone core during salt induced disassembly of NCPs in order to
allow identification of kinetic pathways and transient intermediates that show how the
sequence of events involving DNA unwrapping and protein dissociation are connected.
The investigators found that H2A–H2B histone dimers are released sequentially with an
octasome-to-hexasome transition guided by asymmetric unwrapping of the DNA. This
work suggests a mechanism for NCP remodeling in which DNA conformation facilitates
the reconfiguration of the histone core. This mechanism may be exploited by gene
regulatory proteins as a general strategy to exchange or modify one H2A–H2B dimer
while simultaneously protecting the other. These dynamic structures provide new
insights into the regulation of DNA access during transcription, replication, and repair.
