        To take a static view of proteins and regard them as simple strings
        of amino acids that do grunt work in cells would be a mistake.
        Decades of biomedical research have proven that proteins are
        often large, complex in structure, and, as is becoming increasingly
        apparent, undergo sophisticated changes in space and time in order to keep
        cells functioning properly. Some proteins, when in solution, exhibit dramatic
        fluctuations in their three-dimensional structures, movement that looks like
        breathing. Because this movement has usually been studied in relatively
        dilute solutions, and not in the crowded interior of a cell, it has been difficult
        to know how much of the motion would actually occur in living systems.
        Recognizing the need for a new approach to the problem, researchers used
        the APS to study the breathing motions of a diverse group of five animal proteins.
        Their results provide badly needed modeling of protein movement in
        solution and data that can be used widely in biomedical applications, such as
        therapeutic drug design.

        The researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and the Illinois
        Institute of Technology used computational modeling and wide-angle x-ray
        scattering (WAXS) experiments performed on the BioCAT beamline 18-ID
        at the APS. They studied the breathing motions of a diverse group of five animal
        proteins (solutions of bovine hemoglobin, hen egg white lysozyme, hen
        egg white avidin, bovine serum albumen, and equine myoglobin) that represent
        a spectrum of size and structural differences.

        By observing changes at varying protein concentrations and temperatures,
        the group was able to quantify spatial changes in this diverse array of
        molecules and, for the first time, present a set of techniques by which this
        quantification can be standardized.

        The studies revealed motion in the three-dimensional protein structures
        that increased with decreasing protein concentration and increasing temperature
        and—perhaps most important—varied widely among the proteins. These
        findings point to the need for recognizing both the chemical and spatial
        structure of a protein (as well as its biochemical surroundings) when making
        estimates of protein movement, which was greatly inhibited at high protein
        concentration.

        The proteins varied widely in their kinetic behavior, which depended on
        protein concentration and temperature. Because it exhibited breathing—in
        the form of rigid body motions—that lends itself well to observation
        with WAXS, hemoglobin at high concentration was chosen as the reference
        structure. Compared to hemoglobin, lysozyme at low concentration
        exhibited much less structural fluctuation. Bovine serum albumin
        exhibited about the same amplitude of breathing as lysozyme at very low
        concentration, while myoglobin and avidin exhibited movement comparable
        to hemoglobin (Fig. 1).

        As temperature increased, the breathing in hemoglobin increased
        slightly; this increase was suppressed as the protein concentration, and
        accompanying molecular crowding, increased. Thus, the effect of temperature
        appears to be amplified at lower concentrations. And it seems that when
        proteins have more room to move (when protein concentration is low and
        there is more empty space nearby), more breathing occurs.

        The chemical composition of a protein, called its primary structure, was
        also found to be important. Unlike the other proteins studied, the lysozyme
        and bovine serum albumin, which are stiffened by multiple disulfide bonds,
        showed relatively little increase in breathing in dilute solutions.

        The research team used techniques that allowed an estimate of the
        size of rigid bodies that move during protein breathing. Concluding that
        secondary structures, such as alpha helices, move like rigid bodies during
        breathing, the authors hypothesized that breathing involves slow collective
        movements. Another striking result of the study is that a protein’s attributes
        such as size, structure class, subcellular location, or presence of multiple
        subunits do not seem to correlate with the measured amount of breathing.
        Thus, based on the usual suspects, there is no way to generalize about the
        expected amount of structural fluctuation. Each protein must be studied individually
        to learn its breathing habits under various cellular conditions,
        underscoring the danger of generalizing protein behavior from a limited sample.

        This study provides badly needed modeling of protein movement in solution
        and data that can be used widely in biomedical applications, such as
        therapeutic drug design.
