        Flying insects are among the most successful species on our planet.
        Flight is very metabolically demanding and many insects have found a
        clever way to reduce energy costs in their flight muscles by employing
        a process called “stretch activation, which has been recognized since
        the 1960s as an interesting and physiologically important phenomenon,
        but a mechanistic explanation has been elusive. Now, research at the
        Biophysics Collaborative Access Team x-ray facility at the U.S.
        Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source provides another,
        important step toward a full explanation of stretch activation, which
        also plays an important role in mammalian cardiac expansion and contraction.

        How stretch activation works in the heart is unknown. As contractions
        propagate through the heart, the contraction of one piece of muscle
        tissue stretches adjacent muscle, thereby activating it. The end result
        is a very strong contraction at the end of systole aiding cardiac
        ejection. Heart muscle is much less organized structurally than insect
        muscle and is thus much harder to study using current biophysical
        methods than is the nearly crystalline insect muscle system. Furthermore,
        diffraction patterns from insect muscle have readily identifiable
        diffraction signatures, lacking in mammalian muscle, that indicate
        force- producing crossbridge binding to actin binding sites. The insect
        muscle presents, therefore, an ideal model system to study crossbridge
        action and its regulation.

        The experiments carried out at the BioCAT 18-ID beamline at the
        Argonne National Laboratory APS are the result of collaboration between
        the groups of Michael Reedy at Duke University, Thomas Irving at IIT,
        and researchers from Florida State University, The Scripps Research
        Institute, and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. The experimenters
        used the Pilatus 100K detector newly available at BioCAT to collect
        two-dimensional x-ray diffraction movies (16-ms time resolution, or
        32 frames per wingbeat cycle) of isolated flight muscle from the
        waterbug Lethocerus indicus during sinusoidal length oscillations that
        mimic the wingbeat cycle in vivo.

        Full analysis of all the diffraction features will take some time but
        enough is now known to propose a comprehensive, self-consistent
        structural model for stretch activation. There appear to be connections
        between the thick and thin filaments, at the level of the troponins,
        proteins that normally turn on and off the thin filament by binding
        calcium. Providing there is some calcium present, these connections
        can turn on the thin filament by transmitting strain from the thick
        filaments to the troponins. These long-lived troponin connections
        appear to consist of the same sort of myosin heads that bind to actin
        at so-called target zones elsewhere on the thin filament to generate
        force. Strain in troponin appears to alter its interaction with another
        protein tropomyosin, allowing this long actin-blocking protein to move
        so as to open the binding sites on actin to accept the force producing
        myosin heads.

        Meanwhile, the thick myosin containing filaments are twisting as a
        response to passive stretch at the same time that the actin-containing
        thin filaments are elongating in response to the same stretch. The
        result is more myosin heads brought within range of target zones during
        muscle stretch so that they bind actin more quickly and generate force
        more efficiently.

        These new data and this new model bring together many ideas from many
        places to provide a testable model for stretch activation.

        The Reedy group has been collaborating with the Irving group for more
        than 18 years and this project has been a major motivator for many of
        the technical developments in fiber diffraction at the BioCAT facility.
        The present experiment, providing a solution to a long-standing puzzle,
        has raised much excitement in the muscle biophysics community. Ken
        Holmes of Heidelberg university, who did the very first synchrotron
        diffraction experiment of any kind back in 1970, said recently that
        Reedy’s group has finally accomplished the same insect muscle experiment
        that Rosenbaum, Holmes, and Witz hoped to perform when they innovated
        the use of synchrotron radiation for x-ray diffraction 40 years ago
        (Nature 230, 434 [1971]).
