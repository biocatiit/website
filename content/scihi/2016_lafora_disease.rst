Our cells are brilliant biochemists that solve all sorts of chemistry problems
under difficult conditions. They speed up slow reactions by orders of magnitude,
stuff miles of DNA into tiny spaces, and carefully balance the solubility of
different kinds of molecules in a jam-packed cellular solution. A good example
is the storage of glucose energy in cells in the form of glycogen. Cells can
store up to 55,000 glucose units in water-soluble spheres of branched, polymeric
glycogen. This provides ready energy for rapid response to cellular needs but
also must be managed carefully because too much glycogen accumulation can
activate programmed cell death. This is especially true of neurons, which
consume large amounts of glucose but are particularly sensitive to glycogen
build-up. One example of what can happen when this basic metabolic process
goes awry is observed in Lafora disease, a devastating fatal epilepsy in which
mutations in a single key enzyme result in the formation of insoluble glucan
inclusion bodies that cause neuronal death. Research conducted at two x-ray
beamlines at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS), an
Office of Science user facility at Argonne solved the structure of the enzyme
responsible, the laforin glucan phosphatase. The work has provided important
insights into both the basis of Lafora disease and normal glycogen metabolism.

Patients with Lafora disease develop epilepsy in their second decade and the
severity of their seizures progressively worsens until their death in 5-10
years. A number of mutations have been discovered in the laforin phosphatase
that are responsible for the glycogen solubility defect and the eventual
formation of the insoluble Lafora bodies but developing targeted treatment
requires deeper understanding of how the mutations affect the activity of the
laforin protein. Utilizing the SER-CAT 22-ID-D beamline at the APS, the
research team from the University of Kentucky; the University of California,
San Diego; the University of Notre Dame; the Illinois Institute of Technology;
and the lnstituto de Biomedicina de Valencia solved the structure of laforin
(2.4 Å) in complex with catalytic products maltohexose and phosphate bound to
the laforin dual-specificity phosphatase catalytic domain (DSP) and carbohydrate
binding domain (CBM) in a specific orientation (Fig. 1). Further, the dimeric
architecture of the protein in solution was defined using size exclusion
chromatography-small angle x-ray scattering experiments at BioCAT, resolving
an important outstanding question in the field.

When researchers turned to the question of how Lafora disease mutations affect
the activity of the laforin enzyme, they found that, in addition to harboring
mutations that affect the active site of the DSP domain, Lafora disease
mutations could also be found in the CBM domain and in the interface between
the DSP and CBM domains. Mutations in the DSP domain affected catalytic
activity of the enzyme while those in the CBM domain were found to reduce
glycogen binding and overall protein stability. Those in the domain interface
diminished enzymatic activity but not glycogen binding. These data suggest
that the unique tetramodular orientation of the domains is critical to laforin
function. Also, unlike its enzymatic relative in plants that breaks down
starch, laforin binds to multiple maltohexose chains in a particular
orientation instead of one long carbohydrate along the length of the DSP and
CBM domains. This leaves open an important question regarding how laforin acts
on branch points in the glycogen polymer and will be the focus of the team’s
future work.

Recent work in the field of epilepsy has suggested that, rather than being a
defect of neuronal firing, epilepsy may be a metabolic disorder similar to
diabetes. In fact, this hypothesis is also being proposed for Alzheimer’s
disease and glycogen metabolic defects have been linked to neuronal decline
in aging, glycogen storage diseases, diabetes, cancer, and some cardiac
syndromes. This work provides important insights into basic metabolic
processes that have critical underpinnings in many areas.

Understanding how laforin regulates the formation of glycogen spheres and how
the delicate balance of solubility versus fatal neuronal damage is maintained
will be important to development of treatments for Lafora disease and potentially
many others.
