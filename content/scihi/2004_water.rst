        Water may be the most important molecule on Earth, but our understanding
        of its properties is embarrassingly limited. In solid ice form, water
        takes on numerous phases and structures that can be studied by
        means of diffraction techniques. As a liquid, however, water poses a
        frustrating structural puzzle because of the complex hydrogen bonding
        that forms a disordered network. Recently, researchers from the Stanford
        Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, the BESSY laboratory, Stockholm
        University, Linköping University, and Utrecht University have used
        the BioCAT 18-ID beamline at the APS, as well an Advanced Light Source
        (ALS) beamline, to obtain detailed information about the nearest
        neighbor coordination geometry in liquid water.

        Previous experimental efforts to understand water structure
        have relied on several methods including infrared spectroscopy
        and neutron and x-ray diffraction. Unfortunately, the
        structural information provided by infrared spectra is ambiguous
        for water, and diffraction provides only radial distribution
        functions that do not allow unique assignment of local hydrogen
        bonding configurations. In the work reported by Wernet et
        al., x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray Raman
        spectroscopy (XRS) were used to investigate local bonding in
        the first coordination shell of water. In XAS, x-rays are
        absorbed by core electrons close to the nucleus of the oxygen
        atoms in water; in XRS, the x-ray photons are inelastically scattered
        by the oxygen atoms. Both processes are highly sensitive
        to the hydrogen bonds formed by the water molecules. The
        XRS data were collected at the BioCAT 18-ID beamline at the
        APS; the XAS measurements were carried out at the ALS.

        The researchers found that the hydrogen bonding of liquid
        water was very similar to that seen in the surface layers of ice but
        very different from the bonding observed in bulk ice, in
        which water molecules are tetrahedrally coordinated. This new
        finding indicates that, contrary to the conclusions of earlier
        work, bulk water is not predominantly four-fold coordinated.
        Instead, it appears that the x-ray spectroscopy results are consistent
        with quantum chemical models in which the water molecules
        form two hydrogen bonds with their neighbors. In this
        case, liquid water appears to consist of structures made of
        chains and rings, which are, in turn, weakly hydrogen-bonded
        to other chains and rings.

        Members of the research group believe that the work will
        be controversial because many computer simulations over the
        last 10 years tell a very different story. Because computer
        power has increased rapidly and experimental techniques have
        been more difficult to develop, the simulations have outpaced
        the empirical data. Based on the recent models, many scientists
        have concluded that, in changing from ice to liquid, water
        molecules maintain their four-fold tetrahedral network structure,
        but the liquid acquires more defects and disorder in the form of
        different bond lengths and bond angles. The new x-ray spectroscopy
        data discussed here do not support this conclusion,
        however, yielding a two-fold bonding picture instead.

        The debate on the structural picture is likely to continue, but
        these new data show the importance of third-generation facilities
        such as the APS synchrotron. Core excitation spectroscopies—especially
        XRS, which can only be done at the newest x-ray sources—are vital
        to understanding the local structure of a complex system such as water.
