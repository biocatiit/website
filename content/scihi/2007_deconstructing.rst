                **Fig. 1.** . X-ray diffraction patterns of normal mouse
                heart muscle (WT, bottom) and heart muscle from
                mice lacking cardiac myosin-binding protein-C
                (KO, top). Compared with WT muscle, the KO muscle
                matter is shifted toward its thin actin filaments
                (represented by the size of the outermost black dots
                in both images), as opposed to its thick myosin filaments
                (inner dots), implying that cardiac myosinbinding
                protein-C helps keep myosin filaments more
                tightly wound than they would be otherwise.

        The stars of muscle contraction—be it the flex of a bicep
        or the throb of the heart—are microscopic fibers spun
        from the proteins actin and myosin. To play their parts
        properly, these proteins need help from an additional,
        less well-understood molecule known as myosin-binding protein-C.
        Thanks to data collected at BioCAT beamline 18-ID-D
        at the APS, researchers from the University of Wisconsin
        Medical School and the Illinois Institute of Technology have
        gleaned insights into this protein's contribution to a smoothly
        beating heart.

        Heart muscle fibers, like those of skeletal muscle, consist
        of alternating sets of parallel filaments. Thick filaments,
        which are bundles of myosin molecules, overlap at each end
        with thin filaments composed of small actin molecules.
        Connecting the filaments and driving muscle contraction are
        "cross bridges" that project from myosin. When the muscle is
        activated, the cross bridges repeatedly grasp, pull, and
        release adjacent actin, meshing the two sets of fibers
        together. The effect is akin to a person creeping up a chimney
        by pushing down with their arms and legs.

        Cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) accounts
        for only 1-2% of heart muscle protein, but it plays a noticeable
        role. In mice bred to lack the protein, cardiac muscle
        contracts much more easily than that of normal mice, suggesting
        that the protein somehow acts as a brake on contraction.
        To figure out how this works, the researchers first
        extracted pieces of muscle from inside the hearts of the mice
        lacking cMyBP-C and soaked the muscle in solution to completely
        relax it. Next, they probed the muscle's molecular
        structure by measuring its x-ray diffraction pattern on beamline
        18-ID-D. The diffraction pattern encoded two main properties:
        the spacing between actin and myosin filaments and
        the concentration of material along that spacing (Fig. 1). The
        researchers hypothesized that cMyBP-C works as a tether
        on cross bridges that happen to be tucked closer than others
        to their myosin filament at any given moment, preventing
        them from aiding contraction. In keeping with that idea, they
        discovered that the molecular mass in the heart muscle without
        cMyBP-C was less concentrated around myosin.
        Instead, the molecular mass was approximately 30% more
        spread out between filaments than in normal mouse heart
        muscle. The molecular mass was also about 40% more disordered than
        in normal muscle. The research team interprets
        the findings as evidence that more cross bridges than normal
        are projecting farther from the myosin filaments. This
        would explain earlier physiological studies, because such a
        change would allow more cross bridges to take part in contraction,
        resulting in quicker contractions and heightened
        resting tension in the muscles.
