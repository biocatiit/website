                Example negative work-loop at 25ºC and positive work-loop at
                35ºC. The red dot indicates the point of muscle activation and
                the black dots represent times when diffraction images were
                collected throughout the contraction cycle. Diffraction images
                from the time point directly following muscle stimulation
                highlight the temperature dependent variation in the lattice
                structure.

        The Hawkmoth Manduca sexta is an emerging model system for a wide
        range of studies in integrative biology. The flight muscles are
        particularly interesting in that, unlike most insect flight muscle,
        but like vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscles, they are a synchronous
        muscle where each stimulus generates one muscle twitch. The length
        tension curve also shows intriguing similarities to mammalian cardiac
        muscle even though the sarcomere structure is known to be quite
        different. Another property of the muscle is that the dorsal-most
        region of the flight muscle is ca. 5 degrees C cooler than the ventral
        muscle closer to the midline to the body. (Such spatial temperature
        gradients are also likely to occur in large muscles in mammals but
        this has not been well investigated). In Manduca flight muscle these
        spatial gradients lead to a spatial variation in power production
        spanning from positive to negative values across the predicted
        temperature range. Warm ventral subunits produce positive power at
        their in vivo operating temperatures, and therefore act as motors
        producing force. Concurrently, as muscle temperature decreases dorsally,
        the subunits produce approximately zero mechanical power output.
        These muscles, therefore, not only generate force, but also may act
        as springs, providing energy storage to drive locomotion. The question
        addressed in this study is what component of the muscle enables the
        colder muscle to act as springs.

        Using time-resolved small-angle X-ray diffraction paired with in situ
        measurements of mechanical energy exchange in the flight muscle of
        Manduca sexta the authors produced 5-frame, 8 ms per frame, movies
        of the X-ray equatorial reflections indicating cross-bridge association
        with myofilaments. These movies showed cyclical changes in the
        intensities of the equatorial reflections in the warmer, force
        generating muscle and stable equatorial intensities in cooler muscles
        acting as springs. These results indicate that the temperature gradient
        creates a locked-spring lattice in the cooler region of muscle.
        Cross-bridges in that region that remain bound and elastically
        deformed at the end of muscle shortening could release the stored
        strain energy during muscle lengthening. These results suggest that
        cross-bridges can perform functions other than just contraction,
        including acting as molecular links for elastic energy storage.
