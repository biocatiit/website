    Understanding the driving forces behind stability of denatured state
    ensembles (DSE’s) and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP’s) is
    central to a number of unresolved questions in bimolecular thermodynamics
    regarding protein folding pathways and foldability, thermodynamic stability,
    aggregation and misfolding. Researchers at the University of Chicago and
    Notre Dame used temperature-controlled size-exclusion chromatography-coupled
    SAXS (SEC-SAXS) and NMR to examine how temperature and solvent ionic
    strength influences the solution structure(s) of the N-terminal domain of
    pertactin (PNt). PNt is a valuable model system from a fundamental
    biophysical point of view, as the full-length 539-residue pertactin folds
    into a parallel β-helix but the 334 N-terminal residues do not and
    instead behave as a highly expanded, intrinsically disordered chain.

    In this work, the authors used temperature-series SEC-SAXS experiments
    performed at BioCAT, with temperatures ranging from 4 to 60 degrees C,
    to show that PNt displays a mild, temperature-dependent contraction (as
    measured by R\ :sub:`g` value). Glycine-rich low hydrophobicity model
    systems (as proxies for protein backbones alone) did not display an
    analogous trend, showing the specific importance of side chain
    interactions. Increasing the ionic strength of the solvent buffer system
    resulted in an increase in observed PNt chain size over the entire course
    of the temperature series; at high salt concentrations, PNt collapse
    appears to be enhanced, likely due to ion exclusion around hydrophobic
    side chains. The salt and temperature effects appear approximately
    additive. These results are globally consistent with the known phenomenon
    of the hydrophobic effect becoming stronger at high temperatures and
    suggest that the thermodynamic reference state of a DSE may be a function
    of its environment, resulting in different ΔG values for different modes
    of denaturation (i.e. thermal vs. chemical). However, extrapolating to a
    common reference frame still indicates that the various DSE’s (chemical,
    thermal, native and pressure) are overall thermodynamically equivalent.
    The authors conclude by postulating that while the hydrophobic effect is
    the major stabilizing factor in protein folding, additional factors are
    required for folded stability. This work also raises intriguing questions
    about how thermophilic organisms have adapted to temperatures above 60 C
    despite water is generally a poor solvent above those temperatures – in
    fact, thermophilic proteins often have higher charged residue contents,
    which this work would suggest further reduces solvent quality for the DSE’s.
