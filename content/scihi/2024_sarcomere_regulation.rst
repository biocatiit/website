    Muscle contraction is produced via the interaction of myofilaments and is
    regulated so that muscle performance matches demand. Myosin-binding protein
    C (MyBP-C) is a long and flexible protein that is tightly bound to the
    thick filament at its C-terminal end (MyBP-C\ :sup:`C8C10`), but may be
    loosely bound at its middle- and N-terminal end (MyBP-C\ :sup:`C1C7`) to
    myosin heads and/or the thin filament. MyBP-C is thought to control muscle
    contraction via the regulation of myosin motors, as mutations lead to
    debilitating disease. Thick filament based regulatory mechanisms involve
    either sequestering myosin head into an inactive ordered off state close
    to the thick filament backbone or releasing them so that they can interact
    with actin. Strain in the thick filaments, either from a few active heads
    or passively generated by stretching titin, is presumed to act as a trigger
    to release inactive heads. While MyBP-C has been presumed to play a role(s)
    in thick filament activation, details of these mechanisms have been lacking.
    Here the authors used combination of mechanics and small-angle X-ray
    diffraction to study the effects of immediate and selective removal of
    the MyBP-C\ :sup:`C1C7` domains of fast MyBP-C  on sarcomere structure
    and function in permeabilized skeletal muscle. They showed that after
    titin cleavage, the thin filaments were shorter, a result consistent
    with thick-thin filament interconnections that can bear strain.
    Ca\ :sup:`2+` sensitivity is reduced at shorter sarcomere lengths,
    and cross-bridge kinetics are increased across sarcomere lengths at
    submaximal activation levels, demonstrating a role in cross-bridge
    kinetics. X-ray structural signatures of the thick filaments suggest
    that cleavage also shifts myosin heads towards the ON state that is
    consistent with increased cross-bridge kinetics at submaximal Ca\ :sup:`2+`
    and/or a change in the force transmission pathway. Taken together, they
    concluded that the MyBP-C\ :sup:`C1C7` domains play an important role in
    contractile performance.
