            Figure (a) shows a diffraction pattern from untreated muscle
            compared to treated muscle on the right. Intensification of the
            x-ray reflections from the treated muscle indicate a highly
            ordered "super-relaxed" state of myosin motors. Figure (b)
            shows the myosin heads in the compact "interacting head motif"
            which the heads adopt in the super-relaxed state allowing them
            to be packed closely and tightly on the surface of muscle thick
            filaments.

    At its most basic level, the proper functioning of the heart depends
    upon the intricate interaction of proteins that trigger, maintain, and
    control the muscular contractions and relaxations of this vital organ.
    Disruption of those interactions can cause serious pathologies such as
    hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Such disruptions can originate with
    mutations in the primary motor protein involved in heart contraction,
    ß-cardiac myosin, which can alter the rate of ATP hydrolysis and have
    been hypothesized to destabilize its super-relaxed state (SRX). Researchers
    investigated the stabilizing action of mavacamten, a cardiac drug currently
    in phase 3 clinical trials, on the ß-cardiac myosin super-relaxed state
    and its possible therapeutic effects on HCM. Their work, which included
    electron microscopy and low-angle x-ray diffraction imaging at the U.S.
    Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS), was published in
    Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences of the United States
    of America.

    Previous work had hinted that a folded state of the myosin protein, seen
    both in purified form and in isolated filaments and known as the
    interacting-heads motif or IHM, could be analogous to the SRX state,
    although this has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. It has been
    proposed that mutations causing HCM disrupt this state, resulting in a
    higher percentage of myosin heads being available for interaction with
    actin and leading to the hypercontractility of cardiac tissue seen in
    HCM. These investigators, from  MyoKardia, Inc., the Stanford University
    School of Medicine, the Illinois Institute of Technology, Exemplar
    Genetics, the Harvard Medical School, and the University of California,
    San Francisco, first studied this possibility using three separate
    purified ß-cardiac myosin constructs (25-heptad heavy meromysin [HMM],
    two-heptad HMM, and short S1), finding that a fraction of their basal
    ATPase rates were within the range of 0.002-0.004 s-1 which defines the
    SRX state.

    After confirming the slow basal ATPase rate, the team hypothesized that
    they were observing a folded structural state biochemically similar to
    SRX. This was supported by electron microscopy that visualized a
    folded-back myosin structure. They also demonstrated that mavacamten
    slowed ATPase rates to SRX levels and promotes the formation of
    folded-back myosin molecules, suggesting that it acts by stabilizing a
    SRX state.

    The research team also investigated the action of mavacamten in porcine
    and human cardiac fibers. Both showed similar marked effects, with an
    increase in SRX and decreased tension. The low-angle x-ray diffraction
    studies carried out at the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team 18-ID-D
    beamline at the APS showed a significant increase in ordering of the
    porcine myosin heads in both relaxed and contracting fibers on the thick
    filament backbone (Fig. 1). The presence of mavacamten appears to shift
    the on-off state equilibrium of myosin to an off/folded-back state.

    To study one of the best-described ß-cardiac myosin mutations in HCM, R403Q,
    the researchers used a large-animal model of the Yucatan minipig. This showed
    a sharp decrease in SRX levels in R403Q cardiac fibers compared to those from
    wild-type pigs, consistent with the role of this mutation in causing
    hypercontractility. Treatment with mavacamten restored SRX levels to
    normal and reduced fiber tension. The XRD images again showed increase
    in ordering of myosin heads along the thick filament backbone. Further
    studies of human cardiac fibers with the R663H mutation showed similar
    results, showing the destabilizing effects of the HCM mutations on the
    SRX state in both humans and pigs.

    The experimenters emphasize that although the present work does not
    establish an equivalency of the folded-back SRX state with the IHM state,
    it demonstrates some striking insights, particularly that specific myosin
    mutations weaken SRX enough to lead to the hypercontractility seen in
    HCM. The results also confirm the importance of the tail region of
    myosin for a stable SRX state, although uncertainties persist regarding
    the exact molecular structures and charge interactions. Further work
    to better characterize and understand these phenomena promises new insights
    and therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
