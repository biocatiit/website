        Michael Reedy (Duke University) and Tanya Bekyarova (Illinois
        Institute of Technology) are shown in action on the BioCAT beam line
        18-ID at the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Advanced Photon Source (APS),
        Argonne National Laboratory. They are studying mechanisms of stretch
        activation in insect flight muscle.

        Stretch activation is very important in human heart muscle when
        contraction of one part of the heart stretches adjacent muscle tissue
        causing it to respond a moment later by generating more force. This
        action aids cardiac "ejection," i.e., the amount of blood pumped per
        beat. Muscle structure and function can be studied using high-brilliance
        x-ray beams, such as those produced by the APS, and the experimental
        technique time-resolved small-angle fiber diffraction.

        Unfortunately, cardiac muscle is relatively poorly ordered and the
        diffraction patterns relatively uninformative. Fortunately, because
        of its physiological properties, the flight muscle of insects can be
        a good model system for cardiac muscle. And because of its high degree
        of structural order, insect flight muscle produces rich and informative
        \(not to say beautiful) diffraction patterns (image lower right). Muscle
        contracts by the cyclical action of motor proteins called "myosin"
        that bind to particular sites on another protein called "actin." This
        interaction is normally prevented by tropomyosin, a large, rodlike
        protein that blocks the myosin binding site on actin turning the
        system "off." Reedy and Bekyarova are carrying out experiments aimed
        at determining the motion of tropomyosin and how it turns the muscle
        "on" and "off" during the process of stretch activation.
