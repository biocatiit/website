        The research group was able to determine a three-dimensional
        structure for a collagen (Type I from intact rat-tail tendons)
        as it would actually appear in the ECM. The structure is
        breathtakingly complex. The entire super-unit of collagen contains
        collagen segments packed together such that neighboring
        molecules, known as microfibrils, are super-twisted and then
        interdigitated with each other (Fig. 1). The interdigitation
        appears to be responsible for the super-lattice, which is constructed
        of quasi-hexagonally packed collagen molecules. The
        researchers constructed a new electron density map that, for
        the first time, clearly shows how all of the molecular segments,
        including the previously unresolved gap region, are situated
        (Fig. 1C). Also for the first time, the complete path of each collagen
        molecule can be visualized, including how the interdigitated
        microfibrils are arranged. And, perhaps most importantly,
        these data (Fig. 2) all pertain to the native structure of the collagen—how
        it would actually appear in living tissue.

        The term “microfibril” has been used to name the basic
        units, or boards, of the frame created by the collagen molecules.
        The exact structure of the microfibril itself has been elusive—until
        now. By tracing the path of a single collagen molecule
        through several unit cells, the researchers solved this mystery.
        What their analysis reveals is that the microfibril is constructed
        of five one-dimensional, pleated collagen molecules,
        with a right-handed super-twist. This microfibril unit then packs
        with its neighbor to form the observed interdigitation. This intricate
        packing explains why individual microfibrils could not be
        isolated—it is not possible to remove them from the superstructure
        without destroying their own structure.

        This new information about how the collagen molecules
        are stacked and connected makes it possible to develop
        hypotheses about how two molecules related to human disease—decorin
        and the Matrix Metallo-Proteinase (MMP)—
        behave. Decorin appears to be important in proper tissue construction
        via microfibrillar and fibrillar packing; when the gene for decorin is disrupted, fragile skin and connective tissue diseases,
        such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can ensue. The new
        collagen structure provided by the research group shows sharp
        turns in a gap region, freeing up molecular space that could be
        used for decorin binding, especially on the surface of the structure. Collagenase (MMP1), which is active in the extra-cellular
        matrix (and, when malfunctioning, is implicated in heart disease
        and cancer), is thought to rely on the superstructure of the collagen
        molecule for normal binding and activation. Now that this
        three-dimensional collagen structure can be clearly envisioned,
        exactly what happens when MMP functioning goes awry can be
        postulated.

        The newly published collagen structure is especially important
        because it is specific with respect to the microfibrillar substructure,
        as well as the overall superstructure, which leads to
        important insights into the way collagen binds other extra-cellular
        matrix molecules. These data will fill in several gaps for
        researchers studying the biology of the extracellular matrix and
        related tissue disease, where framing is all-important in enduring
        stability.
