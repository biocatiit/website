    Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) provides a way for cells to create
    membraneless micro-environments (“condensates”) that have been
    proposed to be involved in diverse cellular processes including stress
    responses, RNA splicing, mitosis, chromatin organization, and the
    clustering of receptors at membranes. Proteins driving LLPS often contain
    intrinsically disordered prion like domains (PLD’s) that appear to be
    necessary and sufficient to produce LLPS. PLDS’s have a high proportion of
    polar amino acids mixed in with aromatic residues. In a recent paper in
    the journal Science, researchers from St. Jude’s Children’s Research
    Hospital and Washington University at St. Louis used a combination of NMR,
    multiscale simulations and Size Exclusion Chromatography SAXS experiments
    at the BioCAT Beamline 18ID to discover sequence features that determine
    the phase behavior of PLD’s. They used their experimental findings to
    develop a “sticker-and-spacers” model that can predict the phase behavior
    of PLDs on the basis of their sequence. Phase condensation is driven by
    noncovalent, intra- and intermolecular cross-links between stickers (largely
    aromatic residues and other hydrophobic motifs), whereas spacers either
    facilitate or inhibit  the formation of these cross-links  so that the
    phase behavior is determined by the number of aromatic residues and their
    arrangement in the sequence, with uniform patterning of aromatic residues
    promoting LLPS and inhibiting aggregation. This new model can be used as a
    general tool to predict how condensates spontaneously form and dissolve in
    response to changes in protein concentration and other cellular conditions.
