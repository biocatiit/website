    Many of us are familiar with mad cow disease–the neurodegenerative disease
    caused by prions. Although they have a similar name, the less familiar prion-
    like domains (PLDs) refer to something different–unique, low-complexity
    regions of proteins that are capable of regulating gene expression and affecting
    important cellular processes. Prion-like domains have become a topic of interest because
    of their connection with a variety of debilitating brain diseases, such as amyotrophic
    lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. In fact, mutations in PLDs of
    some genes have been shown to cause neurodegenerative disease. For example,
    mutations in PLDs of the genes hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 can cause the
    neurodegenerative disorders ALS and multisystem proteinopathy. A recent study using
    data obtained at BioCAT completed a comprehensive biophysical investigation of
    PLDs in the protein hnRNPA1 to uncover the major behavioral and structural
    features of these domains. This meaningful work may lead to discoveries
    that can help individuals living with such neurodegenerative diseases.

    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating disease
    of the nervous system that affects the brain and spinal
    cord. Patients often present with symptoms such as
    slurred speech, muscle twitching, and muscle weakness.
    Patients lose total control of muscle function as the disease
    progresses, resulting in a fatal inability to perform
    everyday tasks such as eating, breathing, moving, and
    speaking. Age of onset tends to occur later in adult life; at
    present, there is no cure.

    Although the cause of ALS is largely unknown, genetic
    mutations in PLDs is known to be involved. PLDs
    have been shown to impact a variety of important cellular
    processes, such as cell division and understanding how
    cells respond to stress. The proteins hnRNPA2B1 and
    hnRNPA1 serve important functions in the processing and
    stabilization of mRNA. More broadly, PLDs can drive the
    aggregation of proteins within cells.

    Since PLDs have such a palpable relevance to medicine and
    brain health, investigations into their behavior
    and structure are highly valuable. Seeking to better understand
    how PLDs behave and affect molecular aggregation,
    the authors in this study, from St. Jude Children’s Research
    Hospital, Washington University in St. Louis, and
    Washington University School of Medicine, found that the
    temperature-dependent compaction of molecules within a
    liquid solution is determined by the number of aromatic
    residues in PLDs. The uniform patterning of these aromatic
    residues promotes a phenomenon known as liquid-liquid
    phase separation while preventing aggregation. Liquid-liquid
    phase separation is a physical process that
    leads to the formation of two co-existing liquid phases (a
    dilute and a dense phase), which is the underlying
    process for the formation of many non-membrane bound
    cellular compartments. The authors additionally put forth
    an impressive stickers-and-spacers model (adapted from
    the associative polymer field) that can be used to make
    predictions regarding the behavior of PLDs. This study utilized
    multiscale simulations, nuclear magnetic resonance
    spectroscopy, and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to
    uncover behavioral and structural features of PLDs (Fig. 1).
    The SAXS research was carried out using high-brightness
    x-rays at the BioCAT beamline at the APS. The high
    brightness x-rays were essential to characterize small
    differences between structural features of different mutants
    of the PLD.

    The data generated from this work will enable more
    precise characterization of PLDs within cells, which will in
    turn provide the ability to predict how PLDs form and dissolve
    condensates in response to different circumstances
    (e.g., protein concentration, conditions in cells). Given that
    PLDs appear to have an important role in the maintenance
    of brain health, the significant insights into how phase
    behavior and structure of PLDs are coupled may allow for
    the development of PLD-targeted therapeutics that can
    help patients with ALS and other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders.
