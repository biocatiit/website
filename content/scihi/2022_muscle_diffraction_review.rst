            Three possible conformations of an intrinsically disordered protein:
            collapsed (purple), expanded (gold) and a combination of collapsed
            and expanded (red). Image created by Kristina Davis, University

    BioCAT staff have just published a review article, `Ma & Irving, 2022 Int.
    J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23(6), 3052 <https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23063052>`_, on
    the use of small angle X-ray fiber diffraction for studying skeletal and 
    cardiac muscle disease. The article consists of a guided tour of the 
    various diffraction features that can be used to extract specific pieces 
    of information that can be used to provide insights into the structural 
    basis of pathology. The article also contains a comprehensive review of 
    the literature reporting diffraction studies of muscle that illustrates 
    how small angle fiber diffraction has increased our understanding of 
    specific muscle diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated 
    cardiomyopathy, and nemaline myopathy.
