        On average, one hundred billion cells in the human body divide over the
        course of a day. Most of the time the body gets it right but sometimes
        problems in cell replication can lead to abnormalities in chromosomes---resulting
        in many types of disorders from cancer to Down syndrome. Now, researchers
        from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (UPSM) have
        defined the structure of a key molecule that plays a central role in
        how DNA is duplicated and then moved correctly and equally into two
        daughter cells to produce two exact copies of the mother cell. Without
        this molecule, entire chromosomes could be lost during cell division,
        so this work is a major advance in understanding the molecules driving
        human genetic inheritance. Two U.S. Department of Energy x-ray light
        sources, including the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National
        Laboratory, were important tools for the researchers carrying out this
        study.

        The UPSM researchers report, in the September 16, 2010 issue of Nature,
        the structure of the CENP-A molecule, which defines a part of the
        chromosome called the centromere. This is a constricted area to which
        specialized molecules called spindle fibers attach in order to help
        pull daughter cells apart during cell division.

        "Our work gives us the first high-resolution view of the molecules
        that control genetic inheritance at cell division," said Ben Black,
        assistant professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UPSM and a
        coauthor of the study. "This is a big step forward in a puzzle that
        biologists have been chipping away at for over 150 years."

        Investigators have known for the last 15 years that part of cell
        division is controlled by epigenetic processes, the series of actions
        that affect the protein spools around which DNA is tightly bound,
        rather than encoded in the DNA sequence itself. Those spools are built
        of histone proteins, and chemical changes to these spool proteins can
        either loosen or tighten their interaction with DNA. Epigenetics alter
        the readout of the genetic code, in some cases ramping a gene's
        expression up or down. In the case of the centromere, it marks the site
        where spindle fibers attach independently of the underlying DNA sequence.
        CENP-A has been suspected to be the key epigenetic marker protein.

        However, what hasn't been known is how CENP-A epigenetically marks
        the centromere to direct inheritance. In this study, the UPSM team
        found the structural features that confer CENP-A the ability to mark
        centromere location on each chromosome.

        This is important because without CENP-A or the centromere mark it
        creates, the entire chromosome—and all of the genes it houses—are lost
        at cell division.

        Utilizing the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT) 18-ID and
        General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team
        (GM/CA-CAT) 23-ID-D beamlines at the APS, and the 8.2.2 beamline at
        the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
        the group solved CENP-A's structure to determine how it specifically
        marks the centromere on each chromosome and surmise from that how the
        epigenetic mark is copied correctly in each cell division. They found
        that CENP-A changes the shape of the nucleosome of which it's a part,
        also making it more rigid than other nucleosomes without CENP-A. The
        nucleosome is the combination of DNA wound around a histone protein
        core—the DNA thread wrapped around the histone spool. The CENP-A
        nucleosome is copied several times to create a unique epigenetic area,
        different from the rest of the chromosome. CENP-A replaces histone H3
        in the nucleosomes located at the centromere.

        This CENP-A centromere identifier attracts other proteins, and in cell
        division builds a massive structure, the kinetochore, for pulling the
        duplicated chromosomes apart during cell division.

        Besides being a major advance in the understanding of molecules driving
        human inheritance, this work also brings about the exciting prospect
        that the key epigenetic components are now in hand to engineer
        clinically useful artificial chromosomes that will be inherited
        alongside our own natural chromosomes— and with the same high fidelity,
        says Black.
