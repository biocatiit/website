        Fruit flies beat their wings faster than their cellular powerplants can generate the energy needed for flapping. To
        resolve this energetic discrepancy, researchers from the California Institute of Technology, the Illinois Institute of
        Technology, and the University of Vermont used the Bio-CAT beamline 18-ID at the APS to obtain a series of x-ray
        photographs that revealed the flies' secret: A muscle protein used to power wings acts like a spring, storing energy while
        stretched before snapping back. Not only did this finding surprise researchers who study muscle, but the results might
        also help scientists better understand the human heart.

        Drosophila, the fruit fly, beats its wings up and down once
        every 5 milliseconds. Two layers of muscle control this action:
        when one layer contracts, it stretches the other. The stretched
        muscle is then primed to contract; when it does, it stretches the
        first layer and completes the cycle. These cycles occur faster
        than nerve impulses can stimulate them; hence, the muscles
        themselves must keep the beat going.

        To find out how muscles do this, the research team needed
        to visualize the proteins that make muscle contract. Within the
        flight muscle cells, two proteins cooperate to do this. Myosin
        proteins have flexible heads and long tails that bundle together.
        The heads grab filaments made of the protein actin that ultimately
        connect at either end to opposite cell walls. Like a
        bunch of hands pulling on a rope, the myosin heads drag actin
        inward, making the muscle cell shorter. Methods to visualize what proteins look like often require purifying the protein or
        killing the organism in which it exists. Not only did the team
        want to keep the flies alive, but they wanted to watch myosin
        and actin in action. Short bursts of APS's high-intensity x-rays
        allowed them to achieve both goals.

        The researchers tethered flies inside a box (a “flight simulator”)
        and used air and moving lights to convince the bugs that
        they were buzzing around. Then the team took x-ray snapshots
        of the proteins responsible for beating the wings. They synchronized
        the beam's shutter speed with the wing beat's frequency.
        Much like a strobe light reveals the status of a dancer
        instantaneously, synching the wing beat to the synchrotron
        x-rays allowed the scientists to view the positions of the muscle
        proteins at one point in time. The team put together a series of these images taken at different points of the beat to create a
        stop-action film of the protein movements within muscle cells.

        After exposure in the beam, myosin and the other muscle
        components diffract x-rays onto a detector in specific patterns.
        From this pattern, researchers can tell if myosin is grabbing
        onto the actin filament, pulling, or releasing its grasp. In contracted
        muscle, the researchers saw myosin dragging the actin
        filament as expected.

        But when the muscles relaxed, the team saw an unanticipated
        movement. Instead of completely releasing its grasp as
        myosin does in other relaxed muscles, the myosin briefly let
        go, but then snagged the filament again. And the bundle of
        myosin tails—long believed to be stiff for pulling during contractions—stretched
        a bit, due to the second layer of contracting
        flight muscle. This finding suggested to the researchers that
        myosin stores elastic energy in its tail that can be used in the
        next contraction, much like a stretched spring holds onto
        energy and releases it when the spring recoils. The stretching
        also appears to stimulate the myosin and actin filaments to
        again contract the muscle.

        In addition to this novel finding, the technological advancement
        that allows scientists to view the composition of a living
        muscle will now let them study muscle contraction in greater
        detail. Fruit flies are well suited for genetic studies that might
        eventually illuminate how human heart muscle, which is similar
        to a fly's muscle, can fail when diseased. *— Mary Beckman*
