            The authors used size-exclusion chromatography coupled with
            multiangle light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering
            (SEC-MALS-SAXS) at BioCAT on the HT6-Ub constructs with different
            GS and PA linkers to gain insights on how these linkers affected
            the overall conformations and structures of the HT6-Ub hubs.

    Biomolecular condensates are involved in a range of cellular processes
    including stress response, protein degradation and gene expression. These
    condensates contain a wide range of unique macromolecules, but the drivers
    of this condensation, referred to as scaffolds, comprise only a very small
    fraction. The non-driver components are commonly referred to as ligands
    and may not phase separate on their own but nonetheless may help regulate
    assembly, disassembly and other material properties. One such ligand is
    ubiquitin (Ub) or its linked multimers (polyubiquitin chains), which are
    attached as posttranslational modifications to partner proteins and help
    determine various downstream signaling outcomes such as DNA repair. There
    is growing evidence that suggests the involvement of polyUb chains in
    phase separation acts as a mechanism for the reading and interpretation
    of said Ub code in the cell. Research from the Castaneda lab at Syracuse
    University has worked towards understanding the molecular rules by which
    polyUb chains are able to regulate biomolecular condensation.

    To systematically investigate the relationship between polyUb features and
    phase separation, the authors developed a library where they modified
    either the linker length and/or flexibility between the Ub units or the
    binding affinity between Ub and the phase-separating binding partner,
    UBQLN2. A combination of temperature-ramp turbidity assays, size-exclusion
    chromatography-coupled SAXS (SEC-SAXS), multi-angle light scattering (MALS)
    and NMR to characterize a range of different was used characterize how
    differing physical properties modulate phase separation. SEC-MALS-SAXS
    experiments performed at BioCAT were used to characterize the overall
    conformations of the polyUb hubs with linkers of varying lengths and
    flexibilities. The authors found that two main properties of multivalent
    polyUb chains primarily contribute to the regulation of phase separation.
    In particular, they find that the spacing between the binding sites (as a
    consequence of effective linker length) and the Ub-UBQLN2 binding affinity
    are the primary driving forces that enable tunability of the phase separation.
    The overall effect on condensates is more akin to an emergent property as
    opposed to the sum of individual parts. This work provides a set of basic
    rules by which polyUb properties can regulate phase separation, and it is
    likely these frameworks can be expanded to other posttranslational
    modifications in phase-separating systems.
