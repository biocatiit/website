                The first structure of a muntidomain human estrogen receptor
                alpha (hERα).

        Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) plays an important role in the
        development of various physiological functions; in particular, over 70%
        of breast cancers are ERα-positive. Although initial treatments that
        target ERα are often successful, many patients are not responsive or
        develop resistance so new treatment strategies are urgently needed.
        ERα is a nuclear hormone receptor that consists of a DNA-binding
        domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the
        physiological hormone, estrogen, and functions as a hormone-regulated
        transcription factor. The structure of each domain is known but it is
        not clear how these two domains communicate with each other. Thus,
        there is no way to screen for drugs that disrupt this crosstalk. Now,
        work from a team of researchers from Case Western Reserve University
        has probed the structure of the complex and its domain interface. The
        team developed an elegant new approach, based on the new structure, to
        screen small molecules that target the bridging interface in
        ERα-positive breast cancer, with the potential for developing new
        pharmaceuticals to interrupt that communication.

        The ERα project was the team’s first application of their iSPOT
        structural biology platform that combines two complementary
        synchrotron techniques, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and hydroxyl
        radical protein foot-printing, with computational modeling methods.
        The SAXS provides data on the overall architecture of the complex,
        while the foot-printing provides an accurate assessment of solvent
        accessibility and surface topology. Computational docking models are
        used to fit the combined data for the structure of the complex and to
        develop testable hypotheses. These methods allowed the researchers
        achieve medium-to-high-resolution data for the ERα complex and the
        interface between the two domains.

        Hydroxyl radical protein foot-printing was employed at the 5.3.1 x-ray
        beamline of the ALS at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to compare
        the solvent accessibility of amino acids on the surface of either the
        LBD or DBD alone to that of the overall complex to identify residues
        that appeared to be buried in the complex. Six residues were
        identified that appear to reside at the domain interface and form
        two hydrophobic clusters.

        Foot-printing data was then combined with SAXS data from BioCAT to
        provide overall structural information for computational modeling. The
        model showed that the ERα complex resembles an L-shaped boot with a
        short ankle rise and a large foot bed (Fig. 1). The foot bed represents
        the DBD while the ankle of the boot is the LBD and the “tongue” of the
        boot is the interface. Utilizing computational methods, researchers
        demonstrated that the interface is likely to consist of mostly
        hydrophobic contacts with a medium-sized pocket on the LBD.

        To test their modeling predictions, the team mutated residues thought
        to be important for LDB-DBD interactions and tested them in a reporter
        assay as a measure of ER-mediated transcription activity. They found
        that several mutations significantly reduced their transcriptional
        activity. Interestingly, one mutation found in patients with
        endometrial cancer was found to possess significantly higher
        transcriptional activity.

        This first test-drive of the iSPOT system appears to have been a great
        success, providing important information about the unique structural
        features of ERα and a valuable tool for screening for drugs that might
        disrupt the interface between the two domains. These drugs could be
        very useful for treating ER-positive breast cancer using a “burning
        the bridge” strategy by inactivating ERα activity.

        The next step will be to screen the 2000 or so FDA-approved drugs
        and see if any of them are effective in interrupting domain
        interactions. In the future, the team hopes to screen new compounds in
        a larger drug discovery effort.
