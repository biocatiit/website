                The first structure of a muntidomain human estrogen receptor
                alpha (hERα).

        Human estrogen receptor α plays a critical role in cell growth, and
        cancer metastasis. It belongs to a class of proteins called nuclear
        receptors (NR), which typically consist of a DNA binding domain (DBD)
        and a ligand binding domain (LBD). The physical interactions between
        the two domains are characteristic of the different NR proteins and have
        been found to be functionally significant. The structure of this inter-
        domain interface is therefore important to understand how hERα is induced
        by the ligand Estradiol to bind specific genes in order to regulate
        their expression. In order to acquire structural insights into the
        interaction between the DBD and LBD of hERα Dr. Sichun Yang’s team (Case
        Western Reserve University Department of Nutrition, School of Medicine)
        collaborated with BioCAT to acquire small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS)
        data, which was then combined with complementary techniques such as
        hydroxyl-radical foot-printing to get a picture of the key regions that
        have hydrophobic amino acid residues that mediate the interaction between
        the two domains, and the relative spatial orientation of the two domains
        in three dimensional space. The L-shaped structure that hERα showed in
        this study turned out to be a novel DBD-LBD conformation.

        The size-exclusion chromatography SAXS (SEC-SAXS) instrument at BioCAT,
        which ensures the highest possible quality of the sample passing through
        the SAXS cell through a size based separation of the sample from
        aggregates and other contaminants has made on-site biochemical experiments
        extremely convenient and was put to optimal use in studying the
        architectural variations in hERα with and without the ligand. This
        work also demonstrates the power of combining different complementary
        techniques to create a more thorough and validated mechanistic and
        structural understanding of a biological macromolecular system. Modeling
        of data from hydroxyl-radical foot-printing and SAXS was aided by
        molecular dynamics approaches in a multi-technique platform called
        iSPOT (integration of Scattering, footPrinting, and dOcking simulaTion)
        developed by the Yang lab . Furthermore, a functional assay that involves
        measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of a dye-labeled DNA in response
        to varying concentrations of Estradiol bound hERα with selected mutations
        in the inter-domain interface shed valuable light on the mechanism by
        which changes in the LBD can ‘allosterically’ affect the structure and
        function of the DBD. Some of these mutations are naturally found in
        certain cancers and may be key to understanding metastasis and in
        the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
