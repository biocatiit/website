                **Fig. 2.** . The Alzheimer's drug clioquinol kills cancer cells in the
                presence of copper by inactivating a key cellular enzyme
                complex. Shown here are differences in x-ray absorption
                between copper foil (black line), copper chloride (purple),
                and copper complexed with clioquinol (green).

        Prostate cancer struck approximately
        219,000 U.S. men in 2007 and killed some
        27,000 of them, according to National
        Cancer Institute estimates.

        Many types of cancer typically show
        high levels of copper, including tumors of
        the prostate, breast, colon, lung, and
        brain. Traditional chemotherapy works by
        poisoning any rapidly growing cell, which
        includes healthy gut, blood, and hair follicles,
        resulting in hair loss, nausea, and
        other unpleasant side effects.

        If only high concentrations of copper
        trigger clioquinol's harmful effects, these
        researchers noted, then the drug might
        selectively kill tumor cells, causing fewer
        side effects than other chemo-therapies.
        The researchers further noted that two
        clinical trials of the molecule as a treatment
        for Alzheimer's disease did not
        reveal any significant side effects.

        Intrigued by a study reporting that clioquinol shrank lymphoma
        tumors in rodents, the researchers suspected that
        copper could be the key, on the basis of previous work in
        which they observed that copper-containing compounds
        inhibited a protein “garbage disposal,” called the proteasome,
        that keeps all cells running properly.

        The first task was to confirm that clioquinol reacts with
        copper and forms a new complex. This was accomplished by
        x-ray absorption studies performed on the Bio-CAT beamline
        (Fig. 2). Compounds in hand, the group discovered that
        in two human prostate cell lines exposed to the clioquinolcopper
        “bullets,” proteasome activity fell by up to 69%, which
        was followed by a loss of cell surface proteins that recognized
        the male hormone androgen, a known stimulator of
        prostate tumors. In effect, the molecule seemed to rob the
        deadly cells of a key signal that told them to go forth and multiply,
        all by way of the proteasome. As a result, the cells then
        began to self-destruct.

        The compound by itself had similar effects on copperrich
        human prostate cancer cells growing either in a Petri
        dish or in rodents. Researchers believe that copper ions promote
        the growth of new blood vessels that feed tumors, and
        the team observed that this growth (called angiogenesis)
        was reduced in the transplanted tumors exposed to clioquinol
        compared with untreated tumor transplants, suggesting
        that the molecule inhibited angiogenesis as well as the
        proteasome by soaking up the available copper.
