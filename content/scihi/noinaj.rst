		Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, are
		organelles of endosymbiotic origin,
		having evolved from initial engulfment of
		a cyanobacterium by a eukaryotic cell.
		Most of the bacterial genome was
		subsequently lost so that most proteins
		found within chloroplasts are
		synthesized in the cytoplasm as preproteins
		and then imported via
		specialized machinery prior to trafficking
		to their final destination. Protein import
		is accomplished by the TOC (translocon
		on the outer chloroplast membrane) and
		TIC (translocon on the inner chloroplast
		membrane) machineries in the outer
		and inner envelope membranes, respectively. The TOC complex includes a protein
		called Toc75, which serves as the translocation channel along with two other proteins,
		as well as Toc33 and Toc159, which both contain GTPase domains, which help drive
		substrate selection and importation. Structural information for the TOC complex was
		hitherto lacking, hindering the ability of investigators to form mechanistic models for
		function. Here a team lead by Nicholas Noinaj (Purdue University) and Danny Schnell
		(Michigan State University) reported crystals structures of Toc75 consisting of three
		tandem POTRA domains. High quality size exclusion chromatography –SAXS
		experiments at the BioCAT Beamline 18ID were important in establishing that crystals
		structures accurately represented protein structure in solution. The POTRA domains
		may help facilitate preprotein import by directly binding preproteins and orchestrating
		handoff to the TIC complex. Their results support a model in which the POTRA domains
		act to bind and chaperone preproteins as they emerge from the TOC channel into the
		IMS, and function in conjunction with the IMS chaperone Tic22 to prevent precursor
		misfolding or aggregation during protein import. The data, therefore, suggest a model in
		which the POTRA domains serve as a binding site for the preprotein as it emerges from
		the Toc75 channel and provide a chaperone-like activity to prevent misfolding or
		aggregation as the preprotein traverses the intermembrane space.
