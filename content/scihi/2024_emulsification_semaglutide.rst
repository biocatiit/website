                SAXS experiments at BioCAT were used to characterize the
                oligomer-formation phase and internal characteristics of
                colloidal droplets during spontaneous emulsification of a
                peptide-mimic diabetes therapeutic.

    Semaglutide (SMG) is class of modified, acetylated peptide mimic commonly
    used as a commercial therapeutic to treat type-2 diabetes and obesity.
    Like other classes of peptide mimic therapeutics, SMG’s suffer from
    physical instabilities, including various aggregation and degradation
    pathways but also spontaneous emulsification into colloidal structures
    in the presence of certain hydrophobic surfaces, a process often termed
    “ouzo formation.” Researchers at the University of Delaware Center for
    Neutron Science, in collaboration with Eli Lilly, used a variety of
    biophysical methods including small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS),
    circular dichroism (CD) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to elucidate
    the fundamental physical mechanisms behind ouzo formation. SAXS
    experiments at BioCAT indicated that the colloidal droplets consisted of
    aggregated oligomers, which themselves form as a result of self-association
    of the peptides. Together with other experiments, the authors propose a
    mechanism where initial nucleation is catalyzed by adsorption of oligomers
    with a hydrophobic surface, where the effects of specific surfaces can be
    correlated with Hansen Solubility Parameters. Following nucleation (and a
    subsequent desorption step), nucleated droplets grow rapidly, ultimately
    resulting in a colloidal dispersion. This work provides a foundation for
    predicting ouzo-like formation in related molecules, which may help guide
    future formulations and storage methods for a range of therapeutics.
