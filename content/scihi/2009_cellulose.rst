        As humans continue to deplete the Earth’s
        supply of fossil fuels, finding new sources of energy becomes
        a priority. Biomass, such as cornhusks left after harvest, is one
        such alternative energy source. Before efficient use can be
        made of such materials, understanding how to break down
        cellulose—the fiber in human nutrition and the main
        component of much biomass waste—is crucial. With the help
        of the NE-CAT and BioCAT beamlines at the APS and the
        SPring-8 (Japan) beamline BL38B1, an international research
        team from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of
        Tokyo, and the University of Grenoble has identified important
        new features of cellulose structure. Their work provides
        important new details that could be used in designing more
        efficient treatments for cellulosic biomass.

        Cellulose is a complicated macromolecule and only a few living things, including
        the microbes inhabiting the stomachs of cows and other ruminates, have
        figured out how to metabolize it. Yet biochemists and biophysicists
        have made significant progress in learning how cellulose is put
        together and how to break it apart. Among the most promising research
        in this area is the work done with compounds called amines, which
        are used in the processing of cellulose and cellulosic biomass.
        The amines swell the cellulose fibers and make them more susceptible
        to the cellulase enzymes used in converting biomass to biofuels. The
        researchers had already studied how amines affect the naturally occurring
        crystal forms of cellulose, called cellulose I. During the course of
        their studies, the team found that the amines turned the cellulose into
        intermediate crystalline aminecellulose I complexes and then,
        when the amines were removed, into a form called cellulose III that
        happens to be in an activated state for hydrolysis by cellulases. This
        latter finding is good news if the goal is to make cellulose easier to
        turn into biofuels. The researchers were also able to find conditions
        under which they could turn the cellulose III back into cellulose I,
        important information for those who want to clearly understand the
        process and how to control it.

        To add further intrigue to the story, cellulose I can also
        be irreversibly converted to a form called cellulose II, which
        has improved properties for use in textiles. It turns out that, like
        cellulose I, cellulose II can also be converted into cellulose III
        by treatment with amines. As the plot thickened, the research group
        focused more on visualizing the structure and ways of producing
        cellulose III, the form that would be most advantageous for biofuels
        production.

        The investigators had previously reported the first high-resolution
        x-ray data for a crystalline form of cellulose III (III\ :sub:`II`)
        that they produced by treating cellulose II with ammonia. The
        team now extended the emerging picture by using crystallography
        and spectroscopy to determine a new crystal structure for cellulose
        III\ :sub:`II`. Their data reveal diffuse patterns in cellulose III that indicate
        a relatively high level of disorder when compared to naturally
        occurring cellulose chains (Fig. 1). Not only does the cellulose III show
        more disorder, it also is present in three different types of molecular
        conformation. The data also led the researchers to propose a new crystal
        structure for cellulose, a structure that would be consistent with an
        aggregated microdomain structure for cellulose III\ :sub:`II`. Further work
        will help determine if modifying the amine treatment of cellulose II
        will result in a more ordered cellulose III, or whether statistical
        disorder is an inherent property of cellulose III.
