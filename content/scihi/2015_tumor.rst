The dimer structure of an important tumor-suppressing protein, phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN), the second most frequently mutated protein found in human cancer, has been
established by an international group of researchers carrying out studies using the BioCAT
beamline 18ID at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS), an Office of
Science user facility. Their findings provide new insights into how the protein regulates cell
growth and how mutations in the gene that encodes the protein can lead to cancer. The study
was published online in Structure, and appeared in the October 6, 2015 issue.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog is a known tumor suppressing protein that is encoded by the
PTEN gene. When expressed normally, the protein acts as an enzyme at the cell membrane,
instigating a complex biochemical reaction that regulates the cell cycle and prevents cells from
growing or dividing in an unregulated fashion. Each cell in the body contains two copies of the
PTEN gene, one inherited from each parent. When there is a mutation in one or both of the
PTEN genes, it interferes with the protein's enzymatic activity and, as a result inhibits its tumor
suppressing ability.

Membrane-incorporated and membrane-associated proteins like PTEN make up one-third of all
proteins in our body; many important functions in health and disease depend on their proper
functioning. Despite PTEN's importance in human physiology and disease, there is a critical lack
of understanding of the complex mechanisms that govern its activity.

Recently, researchers at Harvard Medical School found that PTEN's tumor suppressing activity
becomes elevated when two copies of the protein bind together, forming a dimeric protein.
PTEN dimerization may be the key to understanding an individual's susceptibility for PTEN sensitive
tumors

In order to reveal how dimerization improves PTEN's ability to thwart tumor development, the
researchers in this study, from Carnegie Mellon University, the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, the Center for Synchrotron Radiation Research and Instrumentation, the
Illinois Institute of Technology, Monash University, Harvard Medical School, the University of
Massachusetts Medical School, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute needed to establish the
protein's dimeric structure. Normally, protein structure is identified using crystallography, but
attempts to crystallize the PTEN dimer had failed.

So the team used a different technique called small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), which gains
information about a protein's structure by scattering x-rays through a solution containing the
protein. This experimentation was carried out at the BioCAT 18-ID-D x-ray beamline
at the Argonne APS. They then used computer modeling to establish the dimer's structure.

They found that in the PTEN dimers, the C-terminal tails of the two proteins may bind the
protein bodies in a cross-wise fashion, which makes them more stable. As a result, they can
more efficiently interact with the cell membrane, regulate cell growth and suppress tumor
formation.

Now that more is known about the structure of the PTEN dimer, researchers will be able to use
molecular biology tools to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of tumor formation
facilitated by PTEN mutations. The researchers also hope that their findings will offer up a new
avenue for cancer therapeutics.
