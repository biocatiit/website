Determining how proteins function on a molecular level is crucial to understanding the
underlying basis for disease. Now scientists using the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced
Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory are one step closer to unraveling the
mystery of how intrinsically disordered proteins work, according to new research published in
*Science*. The team used simulations and high-brightness x-rays to tackle the question. Their
results conclude that these proteins remain unfolded and expanded as they float loose in the
cytoplasm of a cell.

Proteins are chains of amino acids that fold into three-dimensional structures, giving them their
shape and determining the way they interact with other molecules. Many proteins form rigid
structures, but intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are "floppy" and do not fold into a
regular structure. These disordered proteins are floppy because their parts interact just as well
with water as with each other. Up to 30 percent of all proteins are disordered — and must be
disordered in order to work properly.

Researchers have struggled to understand precisely how disordered IDPs are — and how they
work. Their floppy structures make it difficult to extract their exact dimensions, making the
extent of that disorder, along with the strengths of the interactions, unclear. These details are
crucial to understanding how IDPs carry out their necessary functions in cells.

Different methods have yielded different results. Scattering using x-rays suggested they
remained expanded, but fluorescent methods observed the opposite behavior. The answer would
affect how we envision the movement of a protein through its life—essential for understanding
how proteins fold, what goes wrong during disorders and disease and how to model their
behavior.

"We have excellent methods available for determining the structures of proteins that fold into
one rigid structure, but a significant fraction of all proteins are too flexible to be studied using
these methods. Even worse, results from two of the most commonly used methods to study
IDPs disagree with each other," said Patricia Clark, a biophysicist at Notre Dame and co-author
of the study published in *Science*. "So we developed a novel analysis procedure to help resolve
this."

Clark worked with Tobin Sosnick, a professor at the University of Chicago, to develop a new
small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis method that showed most IDPs are more
disordered than previously thought. SAXS is one of the two ways researchers extract
dimensions of IDPs. In SAXS, proteins are placed in the path of an x-ray beam, scattering the xrays
in patterns that contain information on the protein’s size and shape.

"What we need to determine is how "sticky" they are," said co-author Sosnick. "For survival, you
want a protein to "stick" only in the right conformation, and with the right other pieces or
partners at the right times." This stickiness is determined by the protein‟s chemistry and physics.
Clark and Sosnick’s new approach analyzes a broader range of the x-ray scattering pattern than
previous SAXS methods and fits these patterns to IDP structures with different degrees of
disorder generated by computer simulations.

This discovery advances the discussion between researchers who use SAXS to study IDPs and
those who use a different method, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). With FRET,
researchers attach molecules called fluorophores to the protein, then determine the size and
shape of the IDP by calculating the distance between the fluorophores. In recent FRET studies,
researchers have concluded that IDP parts interact more strongly with each other than with
their surroundings, leading to more collapsed structures.

The results in this study, obtained by Clark, Sosnick, and their colleagues using APS highbrightness
x-rays at the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team 18-ID beamline, shed new light
on the controversy between the two research methods, Clark noted. (The APS is an Office of
Science user facility.) Their SAXS analysis method shows that the floppy structures of IDPs are
very close to what would be expected for a truly random structure — which might help prevent
IDPs from accidentally interacting with other proteins.

Many diseases, including many forms of cancer, are caused by mutations that cause a protein
to interact incorrectly with itself or other proteins, Clark said. The advancements made in this
work will enable detailed study of folding and misfolding mechanisms. They also will assist with
development of new strategies to prevent protein misfolding diseases.

"The results are very clear, but contradict the current consensus," Sosnick said. "It's possible that
proteins can avoid unwanted interactions by being expanded." This reduces the chances of them
sticking to other proteins by accident, causing dysfunction or disease.
"While this work is a fundamental, basic research demonstration of protein behavior, the
implications are really broad," Clark said.
