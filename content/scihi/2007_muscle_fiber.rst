                **Fig. 1.** The upper panel (a) shows the M3 x-ray reflection from
                an active single muscle fiber at constant length (L0) recorded
                at APS. The reflection is split into two peaks of roughly equal
                intensity by interference between the two arrays of myosin
                motors shown in red in the cartoon representation of the muscle
                sarcomere (b). When the load on the muscle fiber is
                decreased (c) it shortens, reaching a steady speed (at L4)
                that depends on the load. The M3 reflection recorded at L4
                \(d) has interference peaks of markedly different intensities
                (middle panel), and this signals motion of actin-attached
                myosin motors towards the midpoint of the sarcomere combined
                with some motor detachment (e).

        It has been known that muscle fibers shorten
        slowly under heavier loads and faster under
        lighter loads. Now, researchers from the
        Università degli Studi di Firenze, Università di
        Roma, Dexela Ltd., the Illinois Institute of Technology,
        and King’s College London, using the BioCAT 18-IDD
        beamline at the APS have discovered the molecular
        basis of this fundamental property of muscle function.
        Their work was the cover article for the issue of
        Cell magazine in which it was published.
        Understanding exactly how muscle fibers work helps
        lay the groundwork for the development of new treatments
        for muscle disorders as well as enhancing the
        understanding of athletic performance.

        The researchers gleaned these insights into muscle
        function by using the Bio-CAT beamline to study a key muscle
        protein called myosin. The group characterized the
        interaction of myosin with actin, another protein found in
        muscle. Actin and myosin are arranged within muscle fibers
        in alternating layers of filaments. The actin and myosin layers
        are connected by "myosin motors," which, during a
        muscle contraction, cause the layers to slide over each
        other in opposing directions, similar to the way oars dipped
        into water propel a row boat forward. The shortening of a
        muscle fiber is thought to correlate with the myosin and
        actin sliding over each other in this manner. When several
        fibers contract together, a muscle contraction takes place.

        These researchers showed, for the first time, that muscle
        fibers not only shorten more slowly with a heavier load,
        but that the number of myosin motors attached to actin
        increases directly with increased load, while the size of their
        movement remains almost unchanged. This explanation
        more accurately depicts muscle performance than the previously
        accepted explanation.

        The researchers conducted their experiments on single
        intact fibers, about 5 mm in length, dissected from frog muscle.
        Electrodes were used to deliver pulses of electric current
        to the muscle fibers that simulated what would take place in
        a real-life setting. In this way, the researchers were able to
        record the fiber contractions under various conditions. X-ray
        diffraction data were then collected from the fibers, which
        enabled the researchers to visualize and quantify the movement
        of attached myosin motors as load increased (Fig. 1).

        Simultaneous mechanical measurements enabled the
        researchers to determine that the number of the attached
        myosin motors increased in proportion to the increase in
        load, while the force exerted by each of the myosin motors
        remained constant regardless of the load. This was in contrast
        to what had been previously thought—that the force of
        each myosin motor was higher when the load was higher.
        These researchers found that it was the increased number
        of connecting myosin motors that allows the muscle fiber to
        bear greater weight, not an increase in force within each
        myosin motor.

        The researchers also found that detachment of a
        myosin motor from actin depended heavily on the motor’s
        shape or conformation as a muscle progressed through a
        contraction. The change in shape allowed myosin motors to
        detach more quickly from actin while bearing lighter loads
        and remain attached while bearing heavier loads, a finding
        that gives a molecular explanation for the high efficiency of
        this motor.
