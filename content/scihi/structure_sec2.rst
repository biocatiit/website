	**Fig. 1.** (A) Cartoon (left) and surface diagram (right) of the overall structure and domain organization of human eEFSec. The color-coding is according to the scheme shown below. (B) The GTP-to-GDP exchange on human eEFSec induces an unexpected conformational change in D4, but not in D1. A comparison of the GTP- (light blue) and GDP-bound states (light red) reveals a lack of the canonical conformational change in the EF-Tu-like domain (D1-3). instead, D4 swings ~26° towards the dorsal face of the molecule and away from the trNA-binding site. The view is rotated ~90° clockwise relative to that in (A). 

	

The element selenium is incorporated into proteins through the 21st
amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Such selenoproteins are critically
important to all types of life, suggesting that being able to
accurately decode the Sec codon and correctly placing this amino acid in
proteins is biologically fundamental. however, little is known about biosynthesis
of selenoproteins in eukaryotic cells. To better understand this
process, a team of researchers used data gathered at two APS sectors to
determine the crystal structure of the human translational elongation factor
responsible for recognizing and delivering the transfer rnA (trnA) carrying
Sec to the ribosome. They produced some surprising findings, which suggest
that the mechanism for elongation factor to incorporate selenium into
growing protein chains is different from that of elongation factors associated
with every other type of amino acid.

Standard amino acids rely on the
elongation factors eef1A and ef-Tu.
ef-Tu in particular is made of three
sections, known as domains 1, 2, and
3. To perform its job, ef-Tu utilizes a
molecule called guanosine triphosphate.
Previous research has shown
that during the process of delivering an
amino acid-carrying (or aminoacyl)
trnA into a lengthening protein, one of
the phosphates on the gTP molecule
ef-Tu carries is cleaved off, or hydrolyzed,
which turns it into guanosine
diphosphate (gdP). This triggers a major
conformational change: domain 1 rotates
about 90 degrees away from domains
2 and 3, which helps the trnA
release ef-Tu and subsequent positioning
at the appropriate site on the ribosome.

However, the trnA associated with
Sec requires a different elongation factor.
in prokaryotic cells, that factor is
Selb, and in eukaryotes, it’s eefSec.
both of these elongation factors are
made of four domains. Some studies
have shown that Selb doesn’t undergo
a conformational change after the gTPto-gdP
exchange, but little was known
about the behavior of eefSec.

To learn more about this process,
investigators from the university of illinois
at chicago, the rutgers-robert
Wood johnson medical School, the
university of Texas Southwestern medical
center, the illinois institute of Technology,
and yale university used the
bio-cAT 18-id-d, Sbc-cAT 19-id-d,
and lS-cAT 21-id beamlines at the
APS to determine the crystal structure
of eefSec while it’s complexed with non-hydrolyzable analogs of gTP, as
well as gdP. 

Their findings show that eefSec
has a structure shaped like a chalice:
domains 1, 2, and 3 represent the cup,
a linker region represents the stem, and
domain 4 represents the base (fig. 1).
further investigation showed the presence
of a hydrogen bond between
amino acid residues in domain 3 and
the linker that seemed to act like a
hinge—a clue that something unusual
might take place at this region during
hydrolysis.

Sure enough, when the researchers
determined the crystal structure
of eefSec complexed with gdP,
they found that domain 4 swung 26 degrees
away from the other three domains.
domains 1 and 2 also underwent
small shifts, with domain 1 moving
slightly toward the predicted trnA binding
face and domain 2 toward the opposite
direction.

Although the movement of domains
1 and 2 seem to tighten the Sec-binding
pocket, which could help lower the binding
affinity of the Sec trnA, the movement
of domain 4 is more mysterious.
The authors speculate that the swing of
domain 4 might help eject the trnA and
dissociate eefSec from the ribosome.

more research will be necessary to
better define the reasons behind this
conformational change, the researchers
say. either way, it differs significantly
from the mechanisms that eef1A and
ef-Tu use to deliver their aminoacyl-trnAs
to growing protein chains. The authors
note that another research team
recently revealed that some microorganisms use different codons to encode
Sec, suggesting that more surprises
about this amino acid are in store.
