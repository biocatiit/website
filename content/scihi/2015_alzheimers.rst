    **Fig. 1.** (a) hPreP is comprised of an N-terminal domain (purple) and
    C-terminal domain (blue), which enclose the catalytic chamber and active-site
    (green) (b) hPreP captures Ab using an exosite (dashed box; D) and active site
    (dashed box; C) (c) Close-up of the hPreP active site (blue mesh), bound
    to Ab (gray) prior to cleavage between Ab residues F20 and A21. The Ab
    peptide is trapped in the catalytic site by the S1 site (indicated) (d)

Proteases are specialized enzymes responsible for degrading damaged,
misfolded, or unneeded proteins within the cell. The human mitochondrial
presequence protease (hPreP) breaks down several distinct proteins, including
beta amyloid (Aβ) species known to aggregate and form the amyloid plaques
associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Using a combination of high-resolution
x-ray crystallography and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) at the APS,
researchers from The University of Chicago and the University of Illinois
at Chicago were able to define the mechanism by which hPreP recognizes a
diverse array of amyloid proteins. The findings reveal that hPreP uses a
large catalytic chamber to capture “toxic” peptides on the basis of their
size and charge distribution. Understanding the mechanism of hPreP substrate
recognition and degradation paves the way for the development of small-molecule
modulators of hPreP, which could ultimately serve as a new therapeutic approach
in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

Proteases are specialized enzymes responsible for degrading damaged,
misfolded, or unneeded proteins within the cell. The human presequence
protease (hPreP) is responsible for degrading “presequences,” which
are amino acid sequences that direct newly synthesized proteins to the mitochondria.
Once inside the mitochondria, however, presequences are toxic, and can interfere
with the mitochondria’s ability to provide energy to the cell. In addition to
degrading presequences, hPreP also degrades several Aβ proteins. Aβ peptides,
when they accumulate, form the amyloid aggregates, or plaques, characteristic of
Alzheimer’s disease.

Diffraction data critical for defining the crystal structure of hPreP alone and
bound to Aβ were collected at the SBCCAT 19-ID-D beamline at the APS.
SAXS data were collected at the BioCAT 18-ID-D beamline at the APS.

The data (Fig. 1) reveal how hPreP is able to accommodate distinct molecules
within its catalytic site, and how this enzyme specifically recognizes
amyloid proteins. The high-resolution diffraction patterns of hPreP alone and
in complex with Aβ provide an atomic level snapshot of the large (~13,000 Å)
catalytic chamber and the molecular interactions required for substrate capture
and cleavage. Within this chamber, amino acid residues form a hydrophobic
pocket, a basic pocket adjacent to the catalytic site, and a hydrophobic exosite
distant from the catalytic site. This arrangement indicates that charge complementarity
is a driving force for hPreP’s ability to bind Aβ in an orientation
that permits specific cleavage of Aβ within regions likely to form aggregates.
Additional SAXS data show that in solution, hPreP exists in a mixture of “open”
and “closed” conformations at ~1:4 ratio. Substrate binding promotes most of
the hPreP to adopt the “closed” conformation, which induces the alignment of
the catalytic residues in the proper orientation. This observation confirms that
hPreP excludes molecules from the catalytic site on the basis of their size.

The flexibility of hPreP substrate recognition leaves unanswered the
question of whether additional, currently unidentified proteins are targeted
by hPreP for degradation. Identification of hPreP substrates will illuminate
additional roles hPreP has in other important cellular pathways.
