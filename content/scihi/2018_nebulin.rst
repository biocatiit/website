        Force in muscle is generated by interactions between myosin motor
        proteins arranged in thick filaments and their binding sites on thin
        filaments made mostly of the protein actin.  Nebulin is a giant
        actin-binding protein in skeletal muscle that is found along the length
        of the thin filaments but up to now, not much was known about what it
        does to affect muscle function. Mutations in the nebulin protein cause
        the muscles in patients with nemaline myopathy disease to be weak in
        patients, suggesting that properly functioning nebulin is important to
        generate force.  This condition can be recapitulated in genetically
        engineered mice who have mutated nebulin or entirely lack nebulin so
        that the muscles in these animals also show weakness. Investigators
        from the University of Arizona and the Illinois Institute of Technology
        used the BioCAT beamline 18ID to study mice entirely lacking nebulin to
        discover the effects of nebulin on the nanoscale structure of muscle.

        Using X-ray diffraction, they found that the thin filaments were found
        to be 3-fold less stiff in nebulin-deficient muscles and that the action
        of other proteins that normally function to turn on and off the thick
        filament were impaired. As a consequence, fewer myosin motors are recruited
        to their actin binding sites and the muscle generates less force.  So it
        appears that nebulin stiffens the thin filaments and is necessary for
        generating physiological levels of force.
