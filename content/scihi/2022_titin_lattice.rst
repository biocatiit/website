    Muscles can produce more force when stretched to a longer length at the
    same level of activating calcium, a poorly understood phenomenon known as
    myofilament length dependent activation (LDA). It was suggested several
    years ago that passive force generated by the giant elastic protein titin
    could be the length sensor behind this phenomenon, but direct evidence has
    been lacking. Investigators from the University of Muenster in Germany,
    Northern Arizona University, University of British Columbia, and the
    Illinois Institute of Technology used a mouse model with a cleavage site
    inserted into the titin protein allowing titin to be enzymatically cut
    in the mature tissue (with TEVp protease) to make it ineffective.
    Small-angle X-ray diffraction of muscle from these mice with and without
    cleavage showed that titin cleavage diminished the changes in
    length-dependent structural signatures (“priming”) associated with LDA.
    Strikingly, a titin-sensitive, length-dependent structural changes were
    also seen in thin filaments, which seems only possible if there are
    bridging structures between the thick and thin filaments in resting muscle,
    potentially comprised of myosin-binding protein C. These experiments
    firmly established titin as the length sensor in LDA and showed that LDA
    involves structural changes in both thick and thin filaments.
