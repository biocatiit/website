        Early and correct diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is important
        for reasons that go beyond correct diagnosis and treatment of symptoms.
        These reasons include more time to make critical life decisions,
        planning for future care, and maximizing the safety of the person
        with Alzheimer's disease and their family. New scientific results
        relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of AD have been obtained by
        researchers utilizing the U. S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon
        Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory and National Synchrotron
        Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and published
        in the journal NeuroImage. This work points to the use of elevated
        brain iron content, already observed in late-stage AD, as a potential
        tool for early diagnosis. Since the disease is usually diagnosed only
        in later stages after cognitive symptoms appear and treatment may not
        be effective, a method for early detection would be a major breakthrough
        in fighting this debilitating neurological illness.

        It has been known for some time that the formation of amyloid plaques
        in brain tissue is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. These plaques
        may form for years before the patient actually suffers neurological
        symptoms. So, much recent research has focused on finding a way to
        detect the disease in its very early stages when treatment would be
        most effective.

        One line of research has centered on the observation that brains of
        patients in late stages of the disease showed elevated levels of metal
        ions such as iron, copper, and zinc. Measuring metal concentrations
        in cerebrospinal fluid or using magnetic resonance imaging would be
        an attractive technique for early diagnosis because it is noninvasive.
        Until recently, however, not much was known about how metal ions were
        distributed in plaque and non-plaque tissues during various stages
        of the disease.

        Now, thanks to the efforts of the researchers from Stony Brook
        University, Brookhaven, the University of Chicago, the Illinois
        Institute of Technology, and Argonne new light has been shed on
        the relationship between metal content, plaque formation, and Alzheimer’s
        disease.

        The scientists used a model system of amyloid plaque formation in mice
        to investigate how iron was distributed in the brain cortex and hippocampus
        over time. The cortex is the center of higher brain functions such as
        thought and reasoning, while the hippocampus is important for long-term
        memory storage. Malfunction of both of these brain regions is associated
        with Alzheimer’s disease, though the hippocampus appears to be the
        first and most drastically affected.

        The technique of x-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) employed at the
        APS and NSLS allowed the researchers to determine how iron content
        changes as the diseased brain ages. Their results showed that iron
        content is significantly higher in the cortex early in the disease
        and that it corresponds with the onset of plaque formation; interestingly,
        the iron was not found within the plaques.

        Given these findings, it is clear that quantifying brain iron content
        could be a powerful early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease and has
        great potential as a diagnostic tool.

        Lisa M. Miller, biophysical chemist at the NSLS and Stony Brook University,
        recalls how the project came into being: "About 8 years ago, we used
        XFM to analyze the plaques of end-stage human Alzheimer’s disease and
        found the plaques to be loaded with iron, copper, and zinc. So we wanted
        to know whether metal ions were involved in plaque formation and/or
        brain cell toxicity. To do this, we needed the mouse model to study
        metal accumulation in AD plaques over the course of the disease.
        Interestingly, we found that the mouse plaques never accumulated metal,
        except for a small amount of zinc in the late stages. These mice also
        exhibited very little brain cell death. This was in stark contrast to
        humans, where the plaques take up a lot of metal and brain cell death
        is significant."

        Having the right tools and techniques was critical to moving the work
        forward. According to Miller, "Access to synchrotron light sources such
        as the NSLS and APS, where we could employ XFM, was instrumental in
        this work because there is really no other way besides XFM to simultaneously
        image all of the physiological metals (calcium, iron, copper, and zinc)
        in the brain. We were able to use the NSLS to study the plaques, but
        needed the high brightness and small beams at the Bio-CAT 18-ID beamline
        at the APS to efficiently image the large cortex and hippocampus regions."

        Miller says that the team’s work "now leads us to question whether
        metals in the plaques are a sign of metal ion imbalance in Alzheimer’s
        disease, causing brain cell toxicity. Perhaps the ‘metallated’ plaques
        are even toxic themselves. Understanding this mechanism is our direction
        for the future."
