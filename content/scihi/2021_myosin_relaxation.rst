            Two-dimensional x-ray diffraction patterns from resting (left)
            and contracting (right) mouse soleus muscle and the corresponding
            myosin structures. The differences in myosin structures (scallop
            myosin) during resting (left) and contracting (right) can be
            detected by the x-ray patterns. Pattern changes were tracked in
            live muscle in a time resolved manner.

    The molecular interactions between the proteins myosin and actin that
    generate force during muscle contraction are some of the most well-studied
    molecular interactions in biology. However, there are some congenital
    skeletal muscle disorders and types of heart failure where relaxation of
    the muscle, rather than the force generation part of the cycle, appears
    to be the problem, and there are currently no available treatments that
    affect relaxation specifically. A more detailed understanding of the
    dynamics of the relaxation process could help in the development of
    treatments that maintain or increase force generation while repairing
    defects in relaxation. Recent work conducted at BioCAT used a unique
    transgenic mouse model, time-resolved small-angle x-ray diffraction, and
    molecular dynamics simulations to discover more about how myosin and actin
    interact during skeletal muscle relaxation. This research, published in the
    Journal of Physiology, demonstrates that this type of small-angle x-ray
    analysis may be of great value for uncovering the information needed to
    identify new treatments for neuromuscular disorders associated with impaired
    muscle relaxation kinetics.

    The protein-protein interactions between myosin and actin to generate
    skeletal muscle contraction forces involve a cycle that starts with myosin
    thick-filament binding to actin thin filaments to form cross bridges. This
    is followed by conformational changes in the myosin that pull muscle
    filaments toward each other and then release the filament to enter
    relaxation. The process is dependent on many other proteins, calcium,
    and, like so many other cellular processes, the hydrolysis of adenosine
    triphosphate (ATP). In the laboratory, researchers have shown that other
    nucleotides can affect the dynamics of myosin cycling, including the
    naturally occurring 2-deoxy-ATP (dATP) that is a myosin activator that
    enhances the rate and magnitude of force development. However, the reason
    it attracted the interest of this research team is that the effects of dATP
    on contraction kinetics also offer an opportunity to study the relaxation
    process in more detail.

    For the muscle experiments, the team of researchers from the Illinois
    Institute of Technology, the University of Washington, and Cornell
    University was able to take advantage of a transgenic mouse model in
    which the expression levels of an enzyme regulating the formation of
    dATP are elevated in skeletal muscle tissue, increasing the amount of
    dATP in the muscle 25-fold to a total of 1%-2% of total ATP. Comparison
    of time-resolved small-angle x-ray diffraction data from non-transgenic
    mice to the transgenic mouse model tissue obtained at BioCAT allowed the
    team to make some discoveries about the effects of dATP on skeletal muscle
    relaxation (Fig. 1).

    The main observations from comparison of small-angle x-ray diffraction
    data for the two muscles were that, although there were no differences in
    the kinetics of force development compared to the wildtype, the myosin in
    the dATP-enhanced muscles was closer to the actin, took more time for the
    force to drop, had a longer half-time for relaxation, and returned to the
    resting state more quickly. The high time resolution of the high-brightness
    APS x-rays combined with the x-ray diffraction technique allowed the team
    to distinguish the nuanced effects of dATP by capturing the prolonged
    decay in force relative to the wildtype muscle as well as recording the
    faster restoration of the resting state, discrete steps that could easily
    have been missed with less sensitive techniques.

    These findings led the team to ask what is different about myosin in the
    presence of dATP? For this they turned to molecular dynamics simulations.
    Modeling of myosin bound to dATP showed that it adopted more conformations
    with dATP than with ATP and that it particularly favored an extended
    conformation that may be more accessible to actin. In addition, solvent
    accessible surface area (SASA) analysis suggested that dATP increases the
    surface area of actin binding regions, increasing the exposure of
    positively charged residues near the negatively charged actin and
    potentially explaining the observation that myosin in the dATP muscles
    was closer to the actin filaments.
