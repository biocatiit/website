            NEM6 mutations cause changes in thin filament structure.

    Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital non-dystrophic
    myopathies and is characterized by severe hypotonia, muscle weakness,
    feeding difficulties, respiratory failure, and the presence of nemaline
    bodies (rods) in skeletal muscle biopsies.  One form of nemaline myopathy
    is caused by mutations in the KBTBD13 (NEM6) gene. In addition to weakness,
    NEM6 patients have slow muscle relaxation, compromising contractility and
    daily-life activities. The role of KBTBD13 in muscle is unknown, and the p
    athomechanism underlying NEM6 is undetermined. A combination of
    transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced muscle relaxation, muscle fiber-
    and sarcomere-contractility assays, super-resolution microscopy, and low
    angle X-ray diffraction on the BioCAT Beamline 18ID revealed that the
    impaired muscle relaxation kinetics in NEM6 patients are caused by
    structural changes in the thin filament, a sarcomeric microstructure. Using
    homology modeling, binding- and contractility assays with recombinant KBTBD13,
    novel Kbtbd13-knockout and Kbtbd13R408C-knockin mouse models and a
    transgenic zebrafish model the authors discovered that KBTBD13 binds to
    actin – a major constituent of the thin filament - and that mutations in
    KBTBD13 cause structural changes impairing muscle relaxation kinetics. The
    authors propose that this actin-based impaired relaxation is central to NEM6
    pathology.
