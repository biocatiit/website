            A) Representative X-ray diffraction patterns from permeabilized
            porcine myocardium under relaxing conditions (pCa 8, Top) and
            activating conditions (pCa 4.5) with (Bottom Right) and without
            (Bottom Left) mavacamten in the absence of active force (treated
            with 100 μM MYK-7660). (B-E) Changes in diffraction signatures
            of off to on transitions in the myosin heads, as a function of
            calcium concentration, showing that Ca\ :sup:`2+` induced
            structural changes in the thick filament were blunted but not
            eliminated by the presence of mavacamten.

    Mavacamten is the first myosin-targeted small-molecule therapy approved
    by the Food and Drug Administration to treat obstructive hypertrophic
    cardiomyopathy by attenuating excessive myocardial sarcomere activity.
    Mavacamten regulates cardiac function at the sarcomere level by selectively
    but reversibly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of myosin. It shifts myosin
    toward ordered off states close to the thick filament backbone making them
    unavailable for binding to actin and generating force.  It is necessary,
    however for the heart to adjust its output to ensure sufficient cardiac
    output, especially during increased physiological demands. It was unknown
    whether mavacamten stabilized heads could still be recruited by the usual
    physiological inotropic mechanisms for the patient to be able to adapt to
    changing demands on their hearts.

    The authors of this study provided direct evidence that all major
    inotropic interventions are preserved in the setting of mavacamten.
    In particular, cardiac myosins stabilized in off state(s) by mavacamten
    were shown to be  recruitable by 1) Ca\ :sup:`2+`, 2) increased
    chronotropy [heart rate (HR)], 3) stretch, and 4) β-adrenergic (β-AR)
    stimulation.  At the molecular level, X-ray diffraction experiments a
    t BioCAT showed that Ca\ :sup:`2+` was able to increase myosin ATPase
    activity by shifting mavacamten-stabilized myosin heads from the inactive
    super-relaxed state to the active disordered relaxed state. At the
    myofilament level, both Ca2+ and passive lengthening shifted
    mavacamten-ordered off myosin heads from positions close to the thick
    filament backbone to disordered on states closer to the thin filaments.
    In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, increased stimulation rates enhanced
    shortening fraction in mavacamten-treated cells. This observation was
    confirmed in vivo in telemetered rats, where left-ventricular dP/dtmax,
    an index of inotropy, increased with HR in mavacamten-treated animals.
    Finally, they were able to show that β-AR stimulation in vivo increases
    left-ventricular function and stroke volume in the setting of mavacamten.
    Taken together, their data demonstrated that the mavacamten-promoted off
    states of myosin in the thick filament are at least partially activable,
    thus preserving cardiac reserve mechanisms.
