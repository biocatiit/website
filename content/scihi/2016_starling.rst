The Frank-Starling law of the heart is a basic physiological principle
first observed more than 100 years ago. it describes how the heart
is able to move blood through the body in a regulated way by pumping
out as much blood as it receives. To understand the nature of the molecular
mechanism underlying this important regulatory process, researchers from
Loyola University together with colleagues from the Illinois Institute of Technology
and the University of Wisconsin–Madison conducted x-ray diffraction
experiments at the APS to examine myocardial muscles of rats deficient in
length-dependent activation (ldA) of muscle fibers in the heart. Their work
shows that the protein titin is critically important for transmitting the stretch-induced
signals within the heart’s muscles known to impact the strength with
which the heart contracts. This work not only solves a piece of the mystery of
how the Frank-Starling law determines cardiac function, but provides an avenue
for targeted development of drugs to treat heart failure.

The Frank-Starling law states that the extent to which the heart’s ventricles
(and resident muscle fibers) are stretched when filled with blood during
the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle is directly related to the force with
which the heart is able to pump blood into the aorta during systole (contraction).
This balance is critical for heart function, and is disrupted in patients
with heart failure. In these patients, the heart is not able to move the blood that
fills the ventricles during diastole through the heart so that it can be sufficiently
oxygenated.

Within the walls of the ventricles, muscle fibers are comprised of striated
muscle tissue called sarcomeres. Each sarcomere houses contractile proteins
arranged into bundles of thin and thick filaments made primarily from proteins
myosin and actin, respectively. When these filaments interact, the muscle
contracts, generating force. Previous research showed ldA of sarcomeres
results from an enhanced response of the contractile proteins to the local concentration
of calcium, and that the protein titin, which helps muscles spring back after
stretching or contracting, is important for mediating this effect. In
fact, mutations in titin are known to disrupt the Frank-Starling mechanism. The
nature of titin’s involvement, however, and the reason why muscles, given the
same amount of calcium, exert more force when stretched farther, remained
unclear.

In this study, the researchers used high-brightness x-rays and the x-ray diffraction
technique at the BioCAT x-ray beamline 18-id-d at the APS to observe
sarcomere-length induced changes in muscle filaments that harbored either normal
(WT) or mutant (hm) titin (fig. 1).

Their results revealed that the length-dependent changes observed in
the x-ray diffraction reflections were present only in the normal, WT, muscle.
This means that transmission of the “length signal” in the sarcomeres that
occurs during filling of the ventricles, depends upon titin to induce the structural
alterations in the thick and thin filaments that drive the force of the
contraction. Further, these rearrangements correlate with the degree of titin
strain, supporting the central role of this protein in the Frank-Starling law.

These findings represent a significant advancement in our understanding
of cardiac function and pave the way for future work that may lead to targeted
development of therapies for patients with heart failure.
