        Type II collagen is the principal extracellular matrix (ECM) component
        of mammalian cartilage. It has been shown that lamprey (a cartilagenus
        fish) notochord collagen fibrils are indistinguishable from human
        cartilage fibrils, their differences being minor amino acid sequences
        and in the specific arrangement of the fibrils to build their respective
        ECM's. Recently, the Orgel group demonstrated that a human anti-biglycan
        antibody had the capacity to 'deconstruct' lamprey notochord type II
        collagen fibril bundles to give a pure source of 'thin-fibril' collagen
        fibrils that are primarily composed of type II collagen. This procedure
        provides both a possible explanation for the initiation of Rheumatoid
        arthritis and a means of studying the structural arrangement of tissue.

        This work comprised two principal methods: 1) Using highly focused
        microbeam at BioCAT to locate the most crystalline portions of a
        notochord sample, and collecting data from this region over extended
        periods of time (>15 minutes) using a cryojet. 2) Analysis of TEM data
        from fibril cross-sections to identity the arrangement of collagen
        microfibrils within the thin-fibrils. Using the first method, the Orgel
        group determined the quasi-hexagonal packing of the notchord tissue
        (previously thought to be tetragonal due to limitations in data available)
        and the 2D unit cell. Using this information and the diameter determined
        from X-ray diffraction at BioCAT and TEM data a model of the fibril
        structure was composed. The TEM data of fibril cross-sections was
        parsed with a custom algorithm and it was found that the microfibrillar
        arrangement determined in both methods 1 and 2 was the same, a 8+1
        collagen fibril arrangement. Making sense for the first time, that
        the ratio of collagen type II and XI in cartilaginous tissue is 8:1.
        A pdb coordinate model was composed on this bases and the work will
        be submitted for publication shortly.

        The Orgel group has been a collaborator with the BioCAT beamline since
        shortly after it came on line. The group has worked extensively with
        small and wide angle diffraction, being an early adopter of micro and
        cryo diffraction for fibrious substances. Orgel is now Associate
        Director responsible for scientific leadership in fiber diffraction
        and closely related scientific areas. This work depended critically
        on the development of microdiffraction and cryogenic handling techniques
        for fibrous specimens.
