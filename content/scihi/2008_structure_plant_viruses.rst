                **Fig. 1.** Segments of the potyvirus soybean mosaic virus;
                several virions are also shown in cross-section. The symmetry
                and low-resolution structure of this virus are very similar to
                those of the potexvirus potato virus X, suggesting that
                flexible filamentous plant viruses share a common coat protein
                fold and approximate helical symmetry.

        Viruses are extremely successful at finding ways to circumvent
        just about every host defense system. The secrets to this success
        seem to lie in their simplicity—small genomes and a
        metabolism that relies in part on the biochemistry of the host—
        and in their elegant, often breathtakingly beautiful and highly functional
        structures. Viral architecture, especially the coat protein structure, is intricately
        intertwined with successful invasion and infection of the host. Yet for
        many viruses, and particularly for a very large group of plant viruses, details
        of their structures have remained elusive. But researchers using a high-brilliance
        x-ray beamline at the APS have obtained important details about the
        structures of a soybean and a potato virus. This is good news for crop scientists
        concerned with finding ways to combat viral infestations.

        Over the years, scientists have has invested much time and effort searching
        for methods to learn more about the structures of flexible filamentous
        viruses. By doing so, they hoped to find ways of combating the economic devastation
        resulting from crop loss due to viral infestations. The researchers in
        this study, from Vanderbilt University, the Boston University School of
        Medicine, the Illinois Institute of Technology, the University of Kentucky,
        and Brookhaven National Laboratory, used a variety of techniques, including
        fiber diffraction data collected on the BioCAT beamline 18-ID at the APS, to
        determine that the viruses they studied, and by extension most flexible filamentous
        viruses, have similar coat protein folds and helical symmetry, with a little
        less than nine subunits per helical turn. This new knowledge marks great
        progress in understanding how these plant viruses operate and will help scientists
        figure out how to outsmart the viruses and prevent viral infections.

        The research team determined the symmetry and low-resolution structures
        of a potyvirus (soybean mosaic virus), and a potexvirus (potato virus X).
        These viruses represent the two largest families of flexible filamentous viruses,
        the Potyviridae and the Flexiviridae. Together with some smaller families,
        they make up the largest group of plant viruses. These viruses are of enormous
        economic importance. Members of the potyvirus family account for half
        of the viral crop damage worldwide, but their structures had proved difficult
        to characterize because of such factors as flexibility, instability, and low levels
        of expression. The variety of methods the research team employed—fiber diffraction
        at the BioCAT beamline, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), and scanning
        transmission electron microscopy (STEM)—allowed them to overcome these
        problems and to finally produce structural data.

        The researchers obtained, for the first time, well-oriented fiber diffraction
        data from a potyvirus. They then used these data to determine radial density
        and, when combined with the STEM and cryo-EM data, viral symmetry. The
        cryo-EM, together with the fiber diffraction data, allowed the group to determine
        the overall viral structure and produce a reconstructed image that
        showed the subunit shape and arrangement in this potyvirus (Fig. 1).

        For comparison, the group then went on to study the structure of potato
        virus X at a comparable resolution and to confirm the previously characterized
        symmetry of this virus. The structures and symmetries of the two viruses
        were unexpectedly similar, suggesting that these two virus families, the
        Potyviridae and the Flexiviridae, are structurally related.

        The latter result is surprising in that previous work showed little similarity
        in the proteins making up the coats of these viruses. Now that good
        structural data are available, however, the evidence points to similarity
        and evolutionary relationships between soybean mosaic virus and potato
        virus X, and by implication among all flexible filamentous plant viruses.
        This is good news to crop scientists concerned with finding ways to
        combat viral infestations. It means that when an anti-viral
        treatment based on viral structure works against one virus, there is a
        good chance it will work on others in this group. How viruses so successfully
        infest plants has just become a little
        less secretive.
