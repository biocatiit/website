    Protein folding is one of the fascinating unanswered questions in biology.
    How does an amino acid sequence that is unfolded when it leaves the
    ribosome manage to fold properly into a highly ordered, lightning-fast
    enzyme or sturdy structural protein? Why don’t all the proteins in the cell
    instead just stick to each other, aggregating into a big mess? A unique
    model system in bacteria may hold some of the answers to these questions.
    The system involves the study of what are termed autotransporter proteins,
    which pathogenic bacteria secrete as virulence factors for infection. These
    proteins are synthesized in the bacterial cytoplasm and cross one membrane
    into the bacterial periplasm. Autotransporter proteins then remain in an
    unfolded state in the periplasm until they pass through the outer bacterial
    membrane, folding properly along the way. This highly specialized protein
    folding process has attracted the attention of a team of researchers who
    have used this bacterial system as a model to determine what allows these
    unique proteins to maintain their disordered state in the periplasm. The
    work includes studies carried out at BioCAT and was published in the
    journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United
    States of America. The authors believe their work will provide important
    information toward understanding basic questions of protein folding and
    tests long-held theories about how this remarkable biological process works.

    Current hypotheses on protein folding suggest that folding is initiated by
    formation of secondary structures followed by association of the hydrophobic
    regions of the emerging structure to orient them toward the interior of the
    protein in a process termed hydrophobic collapse. This is thought to make
    globular proteins stable and soluble in the watery environment of the cell.
    However, previous work by this team of researchers from the University of
    Notre Dame and The University of Chicago has shown that, contrary to popular
    belief, intrinsically disordered proteins, which sample a variety of
    conformational forms the way the autotransporter proteins do, can remain
    quite extended in water even if they have high ratios of hydrophobic to
    charged amino acids. This observation has led them to try and understand
    how proteins with high hydrophobic ratios can maintain these extended
    conformations. For this work, they turned to the N-terminal passenger
    domain of the pertactin virulence protein from Bordetella pertussis, a
    typical autotransporter.

    The first step was to analyze the impact of the sequence of the amino
    acids in the passenger domain on the folding process. They made different
    versions of the pertactin domain by swapping amino acids to change the
    clustering of hydrophobic amino acids but keep the overall sequence and
    hydrophobicity ratio the same. They analyzed structural changes in the
    variants compared to the wildtype pertactin domain by small-angle x-ray
    scattering (SAXS) at BioCAT They found that swapping just 6
    of the 334 amino acids (2%) in the N-terminal domain of pertactin to
    increase hydrophobic clustering was enough to induce significant
    contraction of the structure. Also, the more the variants contracted, the
    more likely they were to aggregate.

    This swapping also had functional effects. When they expressed the swap
    variants in bacteria, they found that the ones that contracted more and
    were not as disordered were also not able to maintain a disordered state
    in the periplasm of the bacteria and were not secreted properly. This
    finding suggests that spacing of hydrophobic amino acids must be under
    selective pressure in bacterial proteins to facilitate their virulence
    functions. This hypothesis was borne out by analysis of other
    autotransporter sequences that also appear to have patterning based on
    spacing of hydrophobic clusters.

    Going forward, the team will test the extent of collapse in an even wider
    range of sequences, to more fully understand the importance of maintaining
    a highly expanded conformation prior to folding.
