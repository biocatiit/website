    Current treatments can slow progression of heart failure, but do not address
    the underlying issues, including specific problems that cause systolic heart
    failure.  In this condition, the heart doesn’t contract vigorously enough in
    pushing blood into the body’s circulation. But findings at nanometer and
    millisecond scales, based upon experimental data collected at BioCAT may
    help improve design of therapies directed at motor proteins to rescue failing
    hearts.

    The heart muscle contractions that pump blood are generated by interactions
    between actin and myosin. These motor proteins power movement at the molecular
    level by converting the molecule ATP into energy. Earlier research in the lab
    of Michael Regnier, University of Washington (UW) professor of bioengineering,
    had shown that dATP, a natural variant of ATP, can be used to promote stronger
    heart function.

    However, there remains a pressing need for data to explain why dATP helps
    to increase contractile force in heart disease. A new study headed by Regnier,
    who is a researcher at the UW Medicine Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative
    Medicine and director of the Center for Translational Muscle Research, offers
    new insights, with unprecedented precision, about the nature of dATP. The
    results, which were detailed in the journal Proceeding of the National Academy
    of Sciences of the United States of America, were derived from synchrotron
    x-ray diffraction experiments utilizing the small-angle x-ray scattering instrument
    on the BioCAT beamline 18-ID at the APS. The first author of the paper is
    bioengineering graduate student Joseph D. Powers.

    The research team, which includes scientists from the University of Washington,
    the University of California, San Diego, and the Illinois Institute of Technology,
    hypothesized that dATP  plays the role of matchmaker.

    "Myosin and actin are attracted to each other by electrostatic charges," said
    Regnier, referring to the electrical force that brings two oppositely charged
    objects together. "Our hunch was that dATP enhances the initial attraction
    between these two critical muscle proteins and thereby leads to stronger contractions."

    By developing new experimental and computational approaches, the research
    team showed how small changes in protein structure translate to improved
    performance at multiple scales – the whole muscle, muscle cell, and the
    molecular levels.  Their findings revealed a more holistic picture of the
    mechanisms behind dATP-augmented cardiac contractile force.

    Regnier explained the main takeaways from the study:  "A key finding was
    that small changes on the surface of myosin occur when dATP is used enhance
    its ability to bind with actin. This suggests the structure of myosin can be
    optimized and opens the door to possible new therapies to improve contraction
    of weakened heart muscle. This report offers a novel approach and a new standard
    for design and characterization of future cardiac therapeutics for systolic heart
    failure."
