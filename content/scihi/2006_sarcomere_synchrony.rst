        Any time we move our arms, billions of protein molecules work in unison
        to contract one muscle while letting another muscle relax. The mechanical
        details of muscle contraction have been known for a long time, deduced
        from experiments with frog legs, reconstruction of the proteins
        involved in crystallographic studies, and many other kinds of research.
        But no one has ever taken such detailed time-lapse molecular pictures
        of the proteins at work within living muscle. Researchers from Brandeis
        University, the University of Florence, and Illinois Institute of
        Technology investigated whether the muscle-contracting proteins
        work the same way inside muscles as they do inside laboratories. But
        muscle cells are full of water and the proteins don't line up quite as
        regularly as they would purified in crystals. So rather than spend 30 to
        40 hours collecting data with a typical x-ray tube, the researchers
        turned to the BioCAT beamline 18-ID at the APS. With a million times
        more intensity than a “home source” x-ray tube—and the ability to focus
        the x-ray beam into a narrow line—the team got a detailed view of the
        proteins at work (Fig. 1). Not only did they measure the degree of
        movement of the proteins, but they saw that the proteins synchronized
        themselves in living muscle much better than anticipated.

        Although muscles look like a long single unit to the eye, they are
        actually made up of small segments called sarcomeres, linked together
        along the length of a single cell. Every sarcomere contracts at about
        the same time, shortening the overall length of the muscle. Proteins
        are the workhorses behind the contraction. One row of proteins—known
        as actin—forms a kind of stiff track along which other proteins—called
        myosin—attach. Myosin molecules have long handles that wrap around
        each other to form a connected, rigid backbone. From this backbone
        rise lever arms, which are topped by flexible heads that grab onto the
        actin track. As the lever arm swings on its pivot, the heads pull the
        actin filaments, shortening the sarcomere.

        To view this activity in a living muscle, the team first stimulated
        the thigh muscle of a Rana pipiens (commonly known as the Northern
        Leopard Frog) to make the muscle contract, and then kept the muscle
        tense. They then released the muscle quickly and briefly—within a
        millisecond—so that it shortened by about 1% of its length. At the
        same time, the extreme brilliance of APS x-ray beams allowed the
        researchers to take “snapshots” of the proteins. From the scattering
        of x-rays by the actin and myosin, the team could reconstruct the
        positions of the different parts of the proteins: the track, the heads,
        the handles and lever arms.

        The myosin heads start out almost perpendicular to the actin track:
        about 10º to 15º off, with a group of myosin heads every 14 nm. Then,
        when the muscle shortens, the arms swing a full 60º through the
        perpendicular axis, moving the heads a total distance of 10 nm.

        In addition, the more in-sync the myosin proteins moved with each
        other, the clearer the data were that the team collected. The researchers
        expected the myosin heads to be at a variety of angles. But the lever
        arms only differed by a few tens of degrees from each other. Because most
        other data on actin and myosin have been collected from purified muscle
        proteins, this work reveals a more accurate image of what's going on
        in active, intact muscles.
