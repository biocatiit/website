        In eukaryotic cells, diverse stresses trigger coalescence of various RNA
        binding proteins into so-called stress granules. In vitro, stress-granule
        associated proteins have been observed to demix to form liquids, hydrogels,
        and other assemblies. Demixing of an abundant RNA-binding protein into
        hydrogel droplets, triggered by stress-associated physiological conditions,
        appears to promote cell fitness during stress.

        Here, a U Chicago based team lead by D. Allan Drummond and Tobin
        Sosnick showed that poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1 in yeast), a defining
        marker of stress granules, phase separates and forms hydrogels in vitro
        upon exposure to physiological stress conditions. Other RNA-binding proteins depend
        upon low-complexity regions (LCRs) or RNA for phase separation. Based on unique
        evolutionary patterns, the authors created LCR mutations, which systematically tune its
        biophysical properties and Pab1 phase separation in vitro and in vivo. Mutations that
        impede phase separation reduced organism fitness during prolonged stress. Such
        mutations reduce the thermal and pH sensitivity of Pab1’s demixing and, hence, reduce
        fitness during growth at high temperature and during energy depletion, indicating that
        demixing is adaptive. Together, the results illuminate a uniquely complete path from
        evolved sequence features, to phase separation, to stress-triggered demixing, and finally
        to organism fitness during stress. SEC_SAXS using the BioCAT beamline 18ID at the
        Advanced Photon Source of the unstructured P domain of the poly A binding protein
        allowed examination of how its compaction related to its hydrophobicity, as tuned by
        various mutations, an important component of this model.
