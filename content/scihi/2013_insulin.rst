        SAXS analysis of IDE. Pair distribution functions and scattering curves
        of WT IDE and IDE R767A (C and D), and IDE S132C/E817C (E and F). Curve
        fitting is based on atomic models using the program CRYSOL (single model)
        or OLIGOMER (mixture). D2/D3, D2/D3 pivot; D1/D4, D1/D4 pivot; C, closed
        state; M, monomer; D, dimer; T, tetramer. The diagrams and ratios shown
        below the scattering profiles represent the distribution of mixture that
        could best fit the SAXS data.

        Proteins in living organisms face acute and chronic challenges to their
        integrity, which require proteostatic processes to protect their
        functions. Proper protein function is ensured through protein turnover
        through a balance between synthesis and proteolysis. Amyloidogenic
        peptides, such as amyloid β (Aβ) and amylin, present a major challenge
        to proteostasis, because they can form toxic aggregates that impair
        diverse physiological functions and contribute to human diseases.
        Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a Zn2+-metalloprotease, prefers to
        degrade amyloidogenic peptides to prevent the formation of amyloid
        fibrils. Thus, IDE retards the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

        IDE possesses an enclosed catalytic chamber that engulfs and degrades
        its peptide substrates; however, the molecular mechanism of IDE function,
        including substrate access to the chamber and recognition, remains
        elusive. Here, we captured a unique IDE con- formation by using a
        synthetic antibody fragment as a crystallization chaperone. An unexpected
        displacement of a door subdomain creates a ∼18-Å opening to the chamber.
        This “swinging door” motion uncovered by this study significantly
        advances our mechanistic understanding of IDE function. The swinging-door
        permits the entry of short peptides into the catalytic chamber and
        disrupts the catalytic site within IDE door subdomain. Given the
        propensity of amyloidogenic peptides to convert into β-strands for
        their polymerization into amyloid fibrils, they also use such β-strands
        to stabilize the disrupted catalytic site resided at IDE door subdomain
        for their degradation by IDE. Thus, action of the swinging door allows
        IDE to recognize amyloidogenicity by substrate-induced stabilization of
        the IDE catalytic cleft. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis
        revealed that IDE exists as a mixture of closed and open states. These
        open states, which are distinct from the swinging door state, permit
        entry of larger substrates (e.g., Aβ, insulin) to the chamber and are
        preferred in solution. Because IDE is a key protease in the destruction
        of amyloidogenic peptides and novel biologically relevant substrates of
        IDE, such as MIP-1α and calcitonin gene- related peptide, continue to be
        discovered (11, 32), future studies will address how conformational
        dynamics are linked to the catalytic cycle of IDE and how to control
        such processes. Such information can also provide avenues to design
        IDE-based therapies for modulating proteostasis in humans.

        This is a classic example of where SAXS can be used to test mechanistic
        hypotheses regarding large-scale domain movements in proteins. It is
        also an example where having successful and productive Driving Biomedical
        Projects (in this case with Prof. Tobin Sosnick at Chicago) at a
        particular institution can be used to recruit other excellent service projects.
