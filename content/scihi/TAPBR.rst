TAP binding protein, related (TAPbPr), a novel protein chaperone,
plays a role in loading peptides onto major histocompatibility class i
(mhc i) molecules during the process of immune surveillance. however,
until now, how TAPbPr functions in antigen presentation has been unknown.
researchers investigated the biochemical function of TAPbPr,
comparing it with tapasin, another chaperone with a similar protein sequence.
using direct binding studies, they demonstrated that TAPbPr functions as a
peptide editor, and binds mhc i molecules that are either peptide-free or complexed
with low affinity peptides. because macromolecular crystallography has
so far proven unsuccessful for obtaining high-resolution structural information
on TAPbPr, the researchers instead collected small-angle x-ray scattering
(SAxS) data at the APS. This allowed them to confirm the structural similarities
between TAPbPr and tapasin. The results of this study could lead to ways
to modulate peptide loading in vaccine design, improving T-cell recognition.

TAPbPr is involved in the intracellular
loading of peptides onto mhc i
molecules. mhc i molecules are important
components of the immune system
and are expressed on the surface of
most cells in all species of jawed vertebrates.
many variants of mhc i molecules
exist within a population, and they
bind and display peptides on their surface:
in healthy cells, they display peptide
fragments derived from biosynthetic
pathways—typically from the cell’s own
“housekeeping” proteins—which do not
stimulate an immune response. however,
if a cell is infected by a microorganism,
or if a cell is a dysregulated tumor
cell, mhc i molecules bind and
display peptide fragments of the microbe
or the tumor. These mhc i–antigen
complexes serve as flags on the
cell surface that are recognized by T
cell receptors on cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

TAPbPr shares approximately
20% of its protein sequence with
tapasin, another well-studied chaperone.
Tapasin is part of a complex protein
machine called the “peptide loading
complex,” which is the major loader of
peptides onto mhc i molecules. however,
how TAPbPr functions in peptide
loading has been unclear.

The researchers in this study, from
the national institutes of health, the
u.S. food and drug Administration, and
the university of oklahoma health Sciences
center conducted studies to
characterize the biochemical function of
TAPbPr. They wanted to better understand
how TAPbPr interacts with mhc
i molecules to facilitate peptide loading. They also wanted to determine the
structure of TAPbPr, and to compare it
with the structure of tapasin, which is already
known.

The researchers engineered recombinant
TAPbPr for expression in
an insect cell system. They investigated
the interaction of TAPbPr with mhc i
molecules, by using direct binding studies
including analytical ultracentrifugation,
surface plasmon resonance, and
fluorescence polarization assays.
These studies showed that TAPbPr
functions as a peptide editor and binds
mhc i molecules that are either complexed
with low affinity peptides or emptied
of photolabile peptides by exposure
to ultraviolet light. As noted, researchers
have so far been unsuccessful
in using crystallography to obtain
high-resolution structural information on
TAPbPr. instead of using crystallography,
the researchers in this study took a
different approach to determining and
comparing the structural shapes of purified
TAPbPr molecules and the related
tapasin molecule. by collecting SAxS
data at the bio-cAT 18-id-d x-ray
beamline at the APS, they were able to
calculate a low-resolution envelope for
both tapasin (fig. 1a) and TAPbPr
(fig. 1c). They were also able to fit the
x-ray structures of tapasin and a molecular
model of TAPbPr into their respective
SAxS-determined low-resolution
envelopes (fig. 1).

In this way, the researchers identified
the similarities between the two
molecules that provide the foundation
for investigating the steps of peptide
loading. The results of this research therefore have potential to guide future
studies to modulate peptide loading for
T-cell recognition, as well as in designing
peptide-based vaccines.
