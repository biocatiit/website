    Traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is often referred to as the “invisible
    injury” — while on the surface everything seems normal with brain structure,
    symptoms may present themselves in the behavior of the injured and cannot
    be explained. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
    about 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits,
    hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the United States in 2013 alone.
    Every day, 153 people in the United States die from injuries that include TBI.

    As reported in the Journal of Synchrotron Radiation, investigators from
    Joseph Orgel at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Argonne National
    Laboratory and the Army Research Lab studied the effect of controlled
    amounts of compressive force on rat optic nerves to attempt to identify
    the changes that occur in otherwise normal looking brain neurons due to
    the specific impact forces experienced during head trauma. This
    first-of-its-kind study used x-ray diffraction data obtained at the
    Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (Bio-CAT) 18ID beamline at the APS
    to examine the changes to myelin, the fatty material that wraps around
    nerve cell projections in the brain and other parts of the body. Starting
    with no force and working upwards, researchers detected the exact force
    level at which a detectable change in the myelin structure occurred. The
    changes were subtle, less than a nanometer but they consistently occurred
    at the same small load of force. What is more, the researchers were able
    to measure just how much the myelin sheath changed - reflecting the kind
    of change that occurs in head trauma.

    As a result of this ongoing work, researchers have a better understanding
    of what kind of experience, or injury, leads to what kind of damage in the
    myelin - helping to visualize injuries based on the smallest force
    necessary to cause it. This information may be critical to knowing when
    someone has an injury after an accident but before symptoms emerge, and
    help supports the decision of when and how to treat them.
