        Nature uses collagen everywhere in constructing multicellular animals. There are at least
        20 types of collagen, but 80-90% of the collagen in the body consists of types I, II, and
        III. Collagen type I is used to form skin, tendon, vascular, ligature, organs, bone, dentin,
        and interstitial tissues. Collagen type II makes up 50% of all cartilage protein, and is
        essential in normal formation of such structures as cartilage, the vitreous humor of the eye (the
        clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eyeball of humans and other vertebrates),
        bones, and teeth. To create these structures, collagen molecules are positioned in arrays
        called fibrils, producing what are known as the D-periodic fibrillar collagens. Though previous work
        has given some idea of what the D-periodic structure looks like, technical limitations prevented
        accurate structural studies of collagen type II packing. A research team aided by the Bio-CAT 18-
        ID beamline and the BioCARS 14-BM-C beamline at the APS has remedied that situation by determining
        the molecular structure of collagen type II in living tissues. These results mark significant
        progress in understanding the architectural differences between collagen type I and type II. Using
        these new data, the study of tissue assembly and degradation, such as in osteo- and rheumatoid
        arthritis, can take several leaps forward.

        The special D-periodic arrangement
        in fibrillar collagens arises when
        five fragments from five different collagen
        molecules are arranged to make
        one complete collagen molecule.
        Further packing is accomplished, outside
        of the cell, when multiple fibrils are
        combined to form fibril bundles. The
        fibrils themselves are stabilized by
        cross-linking between collagen molecules
        facilitated by groups of specific
        amino acids known as the telopeptides.
        If the cross-linking is not performed
        correctly, the resulting instability of the
        fibrils and tissue can lead to connective
        tissue diseases, such as glaucoma and
        arthritis, and to skin fragility in normal
        aging.

        The researchers from the Illinois
        Institute of Technology performed their
        investigations on collagen fibrils from
        the lamprey fish, which electron
        microscopy shows to be closely related
        to mammalian fibrils, even though
        some details of the larger scale architecture
        differ. The research group had
        refined their techniques by studying the
        structure of Type I collagen and then
        went on to apply those methods to better
        understand the structure of the
        more common Type II collagen.

        Their major breakthroughs came in
        conducting x-ray diffraction experiments
        on whole tissue samples (Fig.
        1). Their resulting data on notochord
        tissue of adult lampreys give a clear
        picture of the structure of Type II collagen
        in living tissues. Collagen Type II
        was chosen for these studies because it shows marked similarity across
        species, thus allowing starting inferences
        about its amino acid sequence
        and broad application of the structures
        obtained from this study.

        By comparing their newly collected
        data on collagen type II collagen with
        their previously collected data on collagen
        type I, the researchers were able
        to identify critical differences between
        the molecular packing of the two types
        of collagen. Their data led them to
        conclude that these differences in
        molecular packing may be due to the
        specific telopeptide shapes in the two
        molecules. Such information is critical
        to understanding tissue assembly.

        In collagen Type II there is a wellordered
        cross-linking pattern that is different
        from that found in collagen Type
        I. The researchers propose that this
        finding may explain why collagen Type
        II differs from Type I in both fibril diameter
        and fibril bundle organization. The
        Type II molecule has more amino acids
        available for cross-linking than does
        the Type I molecule. This could make
        the Type II molecule more stable and
        ubiquitous in network-like tissue formation.
        But the bulkier nature of the
        telopeptide component in Type II molecules
        could also inhibit the formation of
        Type II molecules as large as those
        observed for collagen type I.

        The diligent work of the research
        team has provided much needed structural
        and mechanistic data on collagen
        fibers. Using these new data, the
        study of tissue assembly and degradation, such as in osteo- and rheumatoid
        arthritis, has taken several leaps forward.
