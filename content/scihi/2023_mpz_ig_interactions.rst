            Tetrameric building blocks are integral to the current models for
            Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` functional assembly in Myelin. The authors used SAXS
            to identify and characterize the tetramerization interface.

    Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease is the most common form of heritable
    peripheral neuropathy, which are a group of inherited diseases affecting
    the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Myelin protein zero (MPZ) is necessary
    for normal myelin structural and function comprises ~50% of all proteins
    in the PNS; mutations in MPZ account for around 5% of CMT cases. MPZ
    is a transmembrane adhesion protein which holds together adjacent myelin
    membranes, thought to be mediated in part through homotypic interactions
    of its extracellular Ig domain.  Exactly how the Ig domain of MPZ
    (Ig\ :sup:`MPZ`) mediates adhesion of apposing membranes is not yet fully
    understood but is nonetheless important for understanding how myelin is
    constructed and how mutations in the Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` cause disease. Models
    for how the Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` might form oligomeric assemblies has been
    extrapolated from a protein crystal structure in which individual
    rat Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` subunits packed together to form 3 weak interfaces
    involving Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` organized tetramers, a ‘dimer’ interface linking
    tetramers together, and a hydrophobic interface that mediates binding to
    lipid bilayers or the same hydrophobic surface on another Ig\ :sup:`MPZ`
    domain. It was not clear whether the proposed Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` interfaces
    actually mediate oligomerization in solution, whether they are involved in
    the adhesion activity of MPZ, are important for myelination, or whether
    their loss results in disease.  The authors performed nuclear magnetic
    resonance spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis
    of wild-type Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` as well as mutant forms with amino-acid
    substitutions designed to interrupt presumptive oligomerization interfaces.
    They confirmed the interface that mediates Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` tetramerization,
    but found that dimerization is mediated by a distinct interface that has
    yet to be identified. They were able to correlate different types of
    Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease symptoms to subregions within Ig\ :sup:`MPZ`
    tetramers. Using this information, they were able to use computational
    docking studies to predict how disease-relevant subregions may mediate
    dimerization of Ig\ :sup:`MPZ` tetramers.
