            X-ray diffraction patterns from permeabilized porcine myocardium
            in relaxing solution in the presence and absence of myosin
            activators. A) X-ray diffraction patterns from relaxed muscle in
            the absence (left panel) and presence (right panel) of 10 µM OM.
            B) X-ray diffraction patterns from relaxed muscle in the absence
            (left panel) and presence (right panel) of 50 µM piperine (PIP).
            Equatorial intensity ratio (I1,1/I1,0) at different concentrations
            of OM C) and piperine D). Myosin heads move radially closer to
            actin as OM and piperine concentration increases as expected for
            myosin activators that promote off to on transitions in the myosin
            heads. These are under conditions where there is no observed
            changes in SRX/DRX ratios.

    Myosin-based thick-filament regulation is now known to be critical for
    muscle contraction with myosin dysregulation found in hypertrophic and
    dilated cardiomyopathies but many details of thick filament regulation
    remain to be discovered. Myosin ATPase assays have demonstrated that under
    relaxed conditions, myosin may reside either in a high-energy-consuming
    disordered-relaxed (DRX) state available for binding actin to generate
    force or in an energy-sparing super-relaxed (SRX) state unavailable for
    actin binding. X-ray diffraction studies have shown that the majority of
    myosin heads are in a quasi-helically ordered OFF state in a resting
    muscle and that this helical ordering is lost when myosin heads are turned
    ON for contraction. It has been assumed that myosin heads in SRX and DRX
    states are equivalent to the OFF and ON states, respectively, and the
    terms have often been used interchangeably. In this study, the authors
    used X-ray diffraction and ATP turnover assays to track the structural and
    biochemical transitions of myosin heads, respectively, induced with either
    omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) or piperine in relaxed porcine myocardium. We find
    that while OM and piperine induce dramatic shifts of myosin heads from the
    OFF to the ON state, there are no appreciable changes in the population of
    myosin heads in the SRX and DRX states in both unloaded and loaded
    preparations. Our results show that biochemically defined SRX and DRX can
    be decoupled from structurally defined OFF and ON states. While previously
    thought to be synonymous, this study finds that biochemical and structural
    thick-filament disengagements have distinct properties and should be
    investigated as independent phenomena. Understanding the details of
    thick-filament regulation will be of great relevance to defining
    sarcomere-level dysfunction in myopathies and understanding and better
    designing sarcomere therapies aimed at reversing them for treatment of
    cardiomyopathy.
