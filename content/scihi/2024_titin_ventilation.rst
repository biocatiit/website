            ICU patient diaphragm produces less titin based passive tension
            increasing interfilament lattice spacing (d10) and reducing calcium
            sensitivity.

Diaphragm unloading during mechanical ventilation is an important clinical
problem. The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration and contracts during
each breath, thereby changing the anatomic configurations of the chest wall so
that air flows into the lungs. Increased diaphragm loading is associated with
diaphragm fiber contractile dysfunction, atrophy and injury. Whereas these
effects of increased loading on the diaphragm take months or years to develop,
the effects of decreased loading, as occurs when ICU patients are mechanically
ventilated, occur extremely rapidly, within hours. For ICU patients with
respiratory failure this mechanical ventilation is considered a life-saving
supportive therapy. However, mechanical ventilation, with its attendant
diaphragm muscle inactivity, can cause rapid diaphragmatic weakness, leading
to difficulties in discontinuing this ventilatory support (i.e. weaning failure).
Weaning failure is a major clinical problem; it is encountered in >30% of
mechanically ventilated ICU patients, it consumes ~40% of all ICU resources,
and, importantly, patients experiencing weaning failure are at much higher
risk for death due to pneumonia and airway trauma. These issues came to the
fore with the large numbers of mechanically ventilated ICU patients during
the COVID 19 pandemic.

Not known is which structures sense the mechanical unloading of the diaphragm
and set in motion the molecular cascades leading to atrophy. Here we test the
hypothesis that the mechano-sensor protein is titin, a giant elastic protein
connecting Z-disks and the thick filaments in the A-band. Titin acts as a
myofilament lattice stabilizer via its passive force running obliquely to
the thin and thick filaments. This results in the production of radial as
well as longitudinal forces in the lattice when muscle is stretched, with
the radial forces tending to pull the thin filament closer to the thick
filament. This increases the likelihood of myosin attaching to the thin
filament, thereby elevating the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation at long
sarcomere length. Our preliminary X-ray diffraction data show that the reduced
titin stiffness in diaphragm fibers from ICU patients expands the myofilament
lattice and that this can explain the observed reduction in calcium sensitivity.
In the proposed work we determine whether myofilament lattice spacing is
affected in diaphragm fibers from mechanically ventilated rats and study
whether this effect is dependent on titin-based passive tension. To critically
test that myofilament lattice expansion is causal to the reduced calcium
sensitivity we will study whether compression of the lattice back to control
values (by using Dextran T-500) restores the calcium sensitivity of force in
ICU diaphragm fibers. Together with transcriptome and protein work, we anticipate
establishing that titin-based mechano-sensing modulates the development of
diaphragm atrophy and weakness during mechanical ventilation. We will also
study the mechanistic basis for diaphragm weakness in mechanically ventilated
ICU patients using, for the first time, diaphragm fibers isolated from biopsies
of these patients. The goal is to investigate whether the findings of animal
studies extrapolate to patients. The obtained results will be compared to those
from rectus abdominus muscle to determine to what extent the observed changes
are specific to the diaphragm or part of generalized muscle weakness.

Interactions between BioCAT staff and this group were very important in
developing the techniques for studying human biopsy samples from diaphragm
muscle. The very small samples would be difficult to study on any beamline
other than 18ID. The proposed experiments will also benefit from the muscle
biophysics support laboratory at the beamline where parallel biochemical assays
can be performed in the same experimental sessions as the X-ray experiments.
