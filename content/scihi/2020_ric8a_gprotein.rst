    Guanine nucleotide binding proteins popularly known as G-proteins,
    involved in a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways are
    heterotrimeric proteins consisting of α, β, and γ subunits. Ric8A is
    known to be both a chaperone for the assembly of the α-subunit of G-proteins,
    and a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF). McClelland et al., have
    conducted a detailed structural analysis on the complex between Ric8A
    and Gαi1 using cryoEM, X-ray crystallography, and SAXS. Constructs of
    Ric8A and Gαi1 optimized for structure determination and to reduce
    conformational heterogeneity were used to assemble the Ric8A-Gαi1
    complex. They were able to determine the interface between the two
    proteins which consists of three separate surface contacts which essentially
    stabilize Gα in its nucleotide-free state. Furthermore, it was found that
    a specific Casein Kinase mediated phosphorylation of Ric8A stimulated the
    GEF activity by structurally stabilizing the Ric8A-Gα interface. Ric8A
    binding to the disrupted Guanine nucleotide binding site on Gα was
    determined to be critical for the GEF function as point mutants at residues
    of Ric8A involved in this interaction compromised the GEF activity. A
    significant amount of re-organization of a particular helical domain in
    Gα relative to the GTPase domain is involved in providing a means for the
    nucleotide to exit. The magnitude of this re-orientation is underrepresented
    in the crystal and EM structures possibly due to the steric hindrance
    inflicted by the nano-bodies used as a strategy to minimize flexibility
    in the structure. SAXS data acquired on the complex without the nano-bodies
    provided a picture of the real extent of conformational variation thus
    illustrating the advantage of using multiple complementary approaches to
    address any given structural biological question.
