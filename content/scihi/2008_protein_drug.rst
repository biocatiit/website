                **Fig. 1.** In this e-coli cell, the proteins (shown in blue) crowd
                around ribosomes (purple). These regions have a high
                concentration of protein, typically greater than 30 percent,
                which limits the ensemble of states into which the
                proteins can bend themselves.

        Proteins, the biological molecules that are involved in virtually every
        action of every organism, may themselves move in surprising ways, according
        to a recent study from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National
        Laboratory that may shed new light on how proteins interact with drugs
        and other small molecules.

        This study, which relied on the intense X-ray beams available at
        Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source, uses a new approach to characterize
        the ways in which proteins move around in solution to interact with other
        molecules, including drugs, metabolites or pieces of DNA.

        "Proteins are not static, they’re dynamic," said Argonne biochemist
        Lee Makowski, who headed the project. "Part of the common conception of
        proteins as rigid bodies comes from the fact that we know huge amounts
        about protein structures but much less about how they move."

        The study of proteins had long focused almost exclusively on their
        structures, parts of which can resemble chains, sheets or helices.
        To determine these, scientists use high-energy X-rays to take snapshots of
        proteins frozen in a single conformation within a highly ordered crystal.
        However, biologists had made relatively little progress in using these
        pictures to show how proteins can reconfigure themselves in different
        environments.

        While scientists had expected proteins to behave similarly in regions
        of high and low protein concentration – from as high as 30 percent
        protein to less than 1 percent protein, respectively – they instead
        found that proteins had a much larger range of motion and could contort
        themselves into many more configurations in the dilute solutions. "The
        difference is comparable to skipping through an open field or being
        crammed into a crowded elevator," Makowski said.

        For more than a century, the standard model of protein behavior depicted
        them as inflexible "locks" that could interact only with a small set of
        equally rigid molecular "keys." Even today’s introductory biology
        courses rely on descriptions of protein behavior that require them to
        swivel and pivot very little as they interact with other biological
        molecules, according to Makowski. "That’s a very powerful image but
        it’s not the whole story," he said. "We’ve learned that proteins in
        solution can take on an entire ensemble of slightly different structures
        and that, for most proteins, this ensemble grows much larger as you
        go to lower and lower concentrations."

        Makowski and his colleagues were also surprised to discover that
        environmental conditions strongly influence which state in this
        "ensemble" of conformations a protein prefers to enter. Most of a
        protein’s common configurations have a functional purpose, he said,
        as it is "not likely to twist itself into something completely irrelevant
        to its function."

        For example, one of the five proteins examined in the study, hemoglobin,
        has two favored conformations: one in which it binds oxygen very readily
        and one in which it does not. When hemoglobin is placed in a solution that
        contains a great deal of available oxygen, it spends most of the time
        in the former state, but when oxygen is not easily accessible, it usually
        flips into the latter. "We now know that in dilute solutions, hemoglobin
        can actually take on both conformations — even in the absence of oxygen,"
        he added.

        By keeping all of the environmental factors the same save for the
        protein concentration in the solution, Makowski and his team discovered
        another surprising result. Scientists had known for many years that when
        proteins are too concentrated, they aggregate and fall out of solution.
        However, biochemists previously had difficulty explaining why a similar
        effect also occurs in overly dilute solutions.

        Proteins have hydrophobic – or "water-hating" – core regions that try
        to avoid touching water if at all possible. Because of this characteristic,
        proteins will rearrange themselves to protect these regions from coming into
        contact with water. In dilute solutions, however, Makowski’s team
        discovered that proteins fluctuate far more than in concentrated solutions,
        and these fluctuations expose the proteins’ hydrophobic core, making
        them more likely to stick to one another or to the container walls.

        The results of the research appeared in the January 11, 2008
        issue of the Journal of Molecular Biology.
