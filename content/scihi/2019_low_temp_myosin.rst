            Low temperatures shift myosin heads from an ordered relaxed state
            to a disordered state that cannot bind actin in response to
            stimulation.

    For many years, contraction in skeletal muscle was assumed to be primarily
    regulated by the binding of calcium to troponin on the thin filaments
    allowing tropomyosin to move unblocking the binding sites for myosin heads
    on the thin filament. More recently, it has been recognized that an
    additional thick filament base regulatory system coexists with thin
    filament regulation. The myosin heads in relaxed muscle are in an ordered
    quasi-helical arrangement around the thick filament backbone where they
    are unable to bind to actin. Current models propose that strain developed
    in the thick filament backbone generated by a small number of disordered,
    constitutively active myosin heads, once the strain surpasses some threshold,
    releases myosin heads form the ordered inactive heads to become disordered
    active heads. At this point, it is commonly assumed that ordered heads are
    in the OFF state, unable to bind to actin, while disordered heads are in
    the ON state, able to bind to actin and generate force. In a recent paper
    in J. General Physiology, researchers from the University Florence used
    the  BioCAT Beamline 18ID to show that this is not necessarily always true,
    at least in mouse skeletal muscle. While in frog muscle, the strain
    dependent mechanoregulation of thick filaments is not affected by
    temperature,  researchers in the Lombardi group (University of Florence)
    suspected that low temperatures might have larger effects on mammalian
    muscle. To test this hypothesis they collected X-ray diffraction patterns
    from intact mouse skeletal muscle at temperatures from 10–35°C. Lowering
    temperature progressively reduces the helical ordering so that the number
    of motors in the OFF state at 10°C is half of that at 35°C. Contrary to
    expectations, the disordered motors appear not to be switched into an ON
    state capable of binding actin, suggesting that that cold temperatures
    creates a population of  myosin motors that is refractory to activation,
    with only those motors remaining in the ordered OFF state available to be
    activated upon muscle stimulation and generate force. At this point, the
    structure and biochemistry of these novel refractory heads is not
    understood, requiring further investigation. The authors speculate that
    the refractory state at cold temperatures may be beneficial to hibernating
    animals whose body temperatures approach ambient values by limiting the
    number of heads that can respond to neural stimulation at low temperature
    reducing metabolic demands.
