            Low temperatures shift myosin heads from an ordered relaxed state
            to a disordered state that cannot bind actin in response to
            stimulation.

    Striated muscle contraction is a highly regulated process that involves an
    orchestrated series of events within the muscle’s contractile units, which
    are also known as sarcomeres. In a recent study, researchers studied the
    effect of low temperature on mammalian skeletal muscle contraction. They
    found that cooler temperatures reduce force generation by trapping
    filaments in the muscle sarcomeres in a refractory state that cannot
    undergo contraction and utilize adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This
    mechanism provides important insight into how hibernating animals may
    conserve energy while still allowing vital functions in the body to continue.

    Muscle tissue’s repeating functional units, the sarcomeres, impart a
    striated or striped appearance to the tissue when examined under a
    microscope. Sarcomeres contain thin (containing the protein actin) and
    thick (containing the protein myosin) filaments that power contraction of
    skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, both of which are striated.

    Contraction of striated muscle is triggered when calcium enters the muscle
    fibers. This leads to structural changes in proteins known as troponin and
    tropomyosin that reside in the thin filament. Ultimately, this allows actin
    and myosin to interact with each other in a way that allows hydrolysis of
    ATP, the source of energy for muscle contraction.

    However, recent studies have shown that structural changes in the thick
    filament play an important regulatory role in contraction. Researchers have
    discovered that when striated muscle is in its relaxed state, myosin is
    trapped in helical tracks on the surface of the thick filament, thus
    preventing its interaction with actin and hydrolysis of ATP. Additional
    studies have also found that myosin protein in relaxed muscle is sensitive
    to temperature changes.

    A multi-national, multi-institution group of researchers recently set out
    to investigate the structural changes that take place in the thick filament
    of mammalian skeletal muscle in response to temperature changes. They
    vertically mounted sections of mouse skeletal muscle on the x-ray path of
    the BioCAT beamline. Then, they collected x-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1)
    from the muscle at different temperatures ranging from near-physiological
    at 35° C to 10° C.

    Their results showed that lowering the temperature below the physiological
    level converts the thick filament from its ordered OFF state to a disordered
    one in which myosin is trapped in a refractory state that cannot bind actin
    or utilize ATP. Also, this effect is temperature-dependent. Progressive
    reductions in temperature lead to more myosins being disrupted on the
    surface of the thick filament. Indeed, only half as many thick filaments
    were left in the ordered OFF state at 10° C as were present at 35° C.

    The drop from physiological temperature to 10° C also produced a 3-fold
    reduction in the amount of force generated by the mouse muscle. This
    refractory state of the thick filament may help explain the decreased
    power output of mammalian muscle at cooler temperatures, and this could
    have important implications for hibernating animals. When animals enter
    hibernation, their body temperature drops to near ambient level, and their
    energy-costly metabolic activities also decrease. Based on the results of
    this study, which show that ATP hydrolysis and energy output also drop
    substantially in resting muscle under cooler temperatures, the researchers
    suggest that this mechanism may contribute to helping animals conserve
    energy during hibernation. Because muscles comprise approximately 40% of
    mammalian body mass, having a regulatory mechanism like this at low
    temperatures can further reduce ATP consumption during hibernation, while
    still maintaining the body’s vital functions.
