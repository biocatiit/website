        The sliding filament model of muscle contraction is more than 50 years old, yet theories about the precise mechanisms
        of the motor function still generate some controversy. A group of researchers from Università di Firenze,
        Istituto Nazionale di Fisica della Materia, Brandeis University, King's College London, the European Synchrotron
        Radiation Facility, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Argonne National Laboratory used insertion device beamlines at BioCAT
        at the APS and at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) to take a closer look at the molecular structure
        of myosin II, the molecular motor in muscle, as it works under different loads. This study provides a more detailed understanding
        of the complex process responsible for the efficient chemomechanical transduction of energy.

        Myosin II is a class of proteins found in skeletal muscle
        and heart cells. Myosin molecules aggregate to form the thick
        myosin filament, with the heads of the molecules protruding
        periodically from the filament. Myosin filaments overlap with the
        actin filaments in the 2.1-μm sarcomere, the elementary contracting
        structure in muscle. During contraction, the myosin
        heads act as tiny motors, drawing the thin actin filament toward
        the center of the sarcomere and then detaching from actin and
        returning to the original conformation, ready for another stroke
        cycle.

        Studies using in vitro samples of muscle tissue have produced
        variable results in measuring the size of the stroke produced
        by the intermittent binding of myosin to actin. These puzzling
        results are likely attributable to the nature of the samples,
        which do not retain their natural structure and function and thus
        are inaccurate measurements of events in a muscle fiber in
        actual physiological conditions.

        To produce a more precise view of these molecular interactions,
        researchers have recently used an x-ray diffraction
        technique to measure the size of the working stroke in vivo, by
        using intact frog skeletal muscle cells. The researchers
        directed parallel synchrotron x-ray beams to the muscle cell.
        This produces a strong reflection called M3, which comes from
        the 14.5-nm repeat of the myosin heads along the filament
        (Fig. 1). The x-ray interference originating from the two arrays
        of myosin heads in each sarcomere allows measurements of
        the axial motion of the motors with ~1 Å spatial resolution and
        submillisecond time resolution.

        At the 18-ID (APS) and ID-2 (ESRF) beamlines, the
        researchers measured changes in intensity and in the fine
        structure of the reflection during three phases of the motor
        cycle elicited at three different loads: 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 times
        the isometric force (T0). To eliminate the damaging effect of
        radiation, which eventually caused the fibers to fail, the samples
        were displaced vertically a few hundred micrometers
        between each contraction. A steady isometric force was
        obtained by electric stimulation of the fiber at the proper frequency—ranging
        from 18 to 25 Hz at the 4°C used in these
        experiments. Then the force was suddenly reduced in a stepwise
        manner through a force feedback control. During the filament
        sliding that follows this step, the two interference peaks into which the M3 x-ray reflection is split change their relative
        intensities. First R, the ratio of the high-angle peak over the lowangle
        peak, decreases; then R increases as the myosin heads
        detach and return to their original axial position.

        The recovery of R occurs at ~6 nm with 0.75 T0 and at
        ~11 nm with 0.25 T0, showing that the axial motion that drives
        filament sliding is smaller at high loads. 

        These observations help explain the efficiency of muscle
