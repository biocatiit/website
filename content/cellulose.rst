:summary: As humans continue to deplete the Earth’s supply of fossil fuels, finding new sources of energy becomes a priority. Biomass, such as cornhusks left after harvest, is one such alternative energy source. Before efficient use can be made of such materials, understanding how to break down cellulose—the fi ber in human nutrition and the main component of much biomass waste—is crucial. With the help of the NE-CAT and Bio-CAT beamlines at the APS and the SPring-8 (Japan) beamline BL38B1, an international research team from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of Tokyo, and the University of Grenoble has identifi ed important new features of cellulose structure. Their work provides important new details that could be used in designing more efficient treatments for cellulosic biomass.

        Cellulose is a
        complicated macromolecule and
        only a few living things, including
        the microbes inhabiting the stomachs
        of cows and other ruminates, have
        fi gured out how to metabolize it.
        Yet biochemists and biophysicists
        have made significant progress
        in learning how cellulose is put
        together and how to break it apart.
        Among the most promising research
        in this area is the work done with
        compounds called amines, which
        are used in the processing of
        cellulose and cellulosic biomass.
        The amines swell the cellulose fi bers
        and make them more susceptible
        to the cellulase enzymes used in
        converting biomass to biofuels. The
        researchers had already studied how
        amines affect the naturally occurring
        crystal forms of cellulose, called
        cellulose I. During the course of
        their studies, the team found that
        the amines turned the cellulose into intermediate crystalline aminecellulose
        I complexes and then,
        when the amines were removed,
        into a form called cellulose III that
        happens to be in an activated state
        for hydrolysis by cellulases. This
        latter fi nding is good news if the
        goal is to make cellulose easier to
        turn into biofuels. The researchers
        were also able to fi nd conditions
        under which they could turn the
        cellulose III back into cellulose I,
        important information for those
        who want to clearly understand the
        process and how to control it.

        To add further intrigue to
        the story, cellulose I can also
        be irreversibly converted to a
        form called cellulose II, which
        has improved properties for use
        in textiles. It turns out that, like
        cellulose I, cellulose II can also
        be converted into cellulose III
        by treatment with amines. As the
        plot thickened, the research group focused more on visualizing the
        structure and ways of producing
        cellulose III, the form that would
        be most advantageous for biofuels
        production.

        The investigators had
        previously reported the fi rst
        high-resolution x-ray data for a
        crystalline form of cellulose III
        (IIIII) that they produced by treating
        cellulose II with ammonia. The
        team now extended the emerging
        picture by using crystallography
        and spectroscopy to determine a
        new crystal structure for cellulose
        IIIII. Their data reveal diffuse
        patterns in cellulose III that indicate
        a relatively high level of disorder
        when compared to naturally
        occurring cellulose chains (Fig. 1).
        Not only does the cellulose III show
        more disorder, it also is present in
        three different types of molecular
        conformation. The data also led the
        researchers to propose a new crystal
        structure for cellulose, a structure
        that would be consistent with an
        aggregated microdomain structure
        for cellulose IIIII. Further work
        will help determine if modifying
        the amine treatment of cellulose II
        will result in a more ordered
        cellulose III, or whether statistical
        disorder is an inherent property of
        cellulose III.
