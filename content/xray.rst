		Manganese (Mn) is an essential element required in trace amounts for proper body function. However, despite its vital role in enzymatic reactions, excessive Mn exposure leads to a condition known as manganism or Mn induced parkinsonism. Clinical signs and symptoms of manganism closely resemble those of Parkinson's disease (PD) and both diseases are pathologically associated with damage to the basal ganglia. While this condition was first diagnosed about 170 years ago, the mechanism of the neurotoxic action of Mn remains unknown. Moreover, the possibility that Mn exposure combined with other genetic and environmental factors can contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease has been discussed in the literature and several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a correlation between Mn exposure and an elevated risk of Parkinson's disease.
