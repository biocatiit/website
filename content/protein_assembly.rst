                **Fig. 1** Protein shape changes in wild type and mutant β-amyloids related
                to classic Alzheimer’s disease and hemorrhagic stroke.

        The researchers focused
        on the β-amyloid coded by the Iowa
        mutation, which differs from the
        normal protein by only one amino
        acid. They found that the mutant
        protein, known as D23N-Aβ40,
        forms fi brils much more rapidly
        than the normal protein and does
        so without fi rst undergoing the
        lag phase observed for the normal
        protein. X-ray diffraction patterns
        from the mutant protein showed
        cross-β patterns and other attributes
        that differed from the normal protein.
        Observing the mutant protein
        using electron microscopy, the team found that it occurs in more
        than one morphotype (organisms
        that are classifi ed together on the
        basis of similar physical features
        without knowledge of their genetic
        relationship).

        Further investigations using
        NMR spectroscopy showed that
        only a minority of the mutant
        protein fi brils looked like the typical
        β-amyloid protein fi brils, which
        exhibit a parallel β-sheet structure.
        Thus, a majority of the mutant
        protein fi brils looked quite different
        from the normal fi brils. Further
        examination of the mutant fibrils indicated that they are put together
        differently and had a smaller average
        diameter when compared to the
        normal fibrils.

        In perhaps the most exciting
        of the new fi ndings presented by
        the investigators, a majority of the
        mutant fi brils exhibited a structure
        consistent with antiparallel β-sheets
        and are thus assembled quite
        differently from the parallel β-sheet
        of the normal protein. This clear
        difference in orientation between
        the mutant and normal molecules
        represents one of the fi rst truly
        distinguishing characteristics
        of the mutant protein and will
        certainly lead to better ways of
        detecting and treating the resulting
        disease states.

        Using these new data, the
        research team proposed a link
        between aberrant assembly and
        tissue pathology of the patients
        carrying the mutation for D23NAβ40
        (Fig. 1). Further work is
        planned to answer questions
        about how exactly the mutant
        protein assembles to produce some
        molecules that look like the normal
        protein, even though most of them do
        not. Previous work by the research
        group showed that examining the
        mechanisms for bends or folds
        between sheets holds promise for
        explaining these differences and
        allowed them to construct a model
        consistent with their current results.
        Additional questions include how the
        substitution of a single amino acid
        in the mutant protein allows it to
        form the very different anti-parallel
        β-sheet structure. And the large
        protein deposits characteristic of
        the disease in patients carrying
        the Iowa mutation, as well as the
        frequency with which β-amyloid
        protein is transported into the blood vessel wall, may also be
        related to how and when the fi brils
        are assembled.

        The work reported by the
        research team points to two
        characteristics of proteins that
        can never be ignored: the amino
        acid sequence and how the protein
        is assembled. In the case of the
        β-amyloid proteins, changing one
        amino acid creates a mutant protein
        that can assemble quite differently
        and lead to diseases such as
        Alzheimer’s, an understanding of
        which may lead to the development
        of new therapeutic options.
