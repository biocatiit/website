:slug: muscle


For online muscle mechanics and X-ray measurements we have a horizontal
muscle mechanics rig equipped with a laser diffraction system including a
linear CCD sarcomere length computer system (Dexela Inc., UK), motors (Aurora
Scientific 308B or Guth Scientific Instruments linear motor Si-MOTDB) and
various force transducers for different force levels, and a high power muscle
stimulator (Aurora Scientific 701B). For higher throughput measurements on
transgenic mouse cardiac muscle samples, many users prefer to use small
individual sample cells that allow length adjustment with sarcomere length
being monitored by an offline video microscope and image analysis system
(Aurora Scientific model 900B). For whole muscle studies we have an Aurora
300B muscle lever system custom modified for fast step response. Also available
are fast shutters, capable of 0.5 ms exposures, storage oscilloscopes and a
National Instruments based A/D, D/A system.
