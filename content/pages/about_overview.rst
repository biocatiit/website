.. lead::   BioCAT is organized as a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biotechnology Research
            Resource and is funded by the National Institute of General Biomedical Sciences
            (NIGMS). Its primary research tool is a very high brightness X-ray beam-line with
            an on-site biochemical preparation laboratory.

The research techniques that BioCAT supports are:

*   Small- and Wide-angle Diffraction from biological fibers
*   Small- and Wide-angle Scattering (SAXS and WAXS) from macromolecules in solution
*   X-ray microprobe imaging


Fiber Diffraction
-------------------

Many biological fibers such as muscle, hair, and viruses have internal structure
which can be probed with X-rays. Using this technique, one can study the
arrangement of proteins in muscle and tendons. It may be used to understand
human maladies such as heart disease and cancer.


Solution Scattering (SAXS and WAXS)
------------------------------------

Most proteins can not be crystallized. For those proteins, it is possible to
study their structure by analyzing the manner in which they scatter X-rays.
This technique is used to study how the proteins and nucleic acids in our cells
function as “molecular machines.”


X-Ray Micro-Imaging
--------------------

When excited by High-energy X-rays, metals will fluoresce. The spectrum of X-rays
emitted from the metal depends on both the metal and its environment. By illuminating
a sample with tightly-focused X-rays, we can determine the content and distribution
of the metals present in the sample. By doing this in combination with Small- and
Wide-angle Diffraction, it is possible to correlate metal distribution with the
distribution of ordered regions in the sample. This technique is used to help us
understand how the distribution of metals (such as iron and zinc) in tissues
affects such things as neurological diseases, normal human development, heart
disease, and cancer.
