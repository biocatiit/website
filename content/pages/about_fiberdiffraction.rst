The design features of the BioCAT beam-line 18 ID and the unique source properties
of the APS allow collection of fiber diffraction patterns of exceptional quality
from complex, weakly diffracting biological systems within very short exposure
times. The small focal spots achievable with this instrument (~50 x 150 μm2)
have allowed excellent discrimination of fine detail in fiber patterns from
muscle, connective tissue, and filamentous viruses as well as detection of
weak diffraction features in the presence of large backgrounds. The low
divergence of the undulator source and the independent horizontal and vertical
focusing of our optics simultaneously allows small beam spots at the sample
and at the detector that can be varied over a wide range. These beam sizes
are very well matched to the resolution of our high sensitivity CCD detectors.
The high X-ray flux of this instrument (~2.0 x 1013 photons/s) permits dynamic
experiments on these systems with a high time-resolution (sub-milli-second).

The available sample-to-detector lengths range from 0.2 to 5.7 m to cover a
very large range of reciprocal space and the CCD detector has very flexible
binning and streak-camera modes for time-resolved experiments. We are
currently developing micro-diffraction capabilities that will allow examination
of ordered structures in regions as small as 5 x 5 μm2. Applications include,
for example, finding small ordered regions in connective tissue for high
resolution studies and mapping amyloid structures in brain tissues that may
be associated with neurodegenerative disease.
