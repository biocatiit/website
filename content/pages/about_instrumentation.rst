:slug: saxs_instrumentation


For static SAXS We have a custom flow cell with a water-jacketed 1.5 mm
diameter quartz capillary for sample observation. This can either be connected
to one of several Hamilton Microlab 500 series programmable syringe pumps or
to the output of one of the FPLCâ€™s. We have an AKTA and Akta Pure FPLC apparatus
for liquid chromatography and a Malvern Zetasizer Dynamic Light Scattering
apparatus. We have two ISCO model 500D and four Harvard Instrument model PHD
4400 programmable, high-pressure pumps for the continuous flow mixer project.
We have two Biologic SFM-400 stopped flow mixers, one with an MEC 22998
microvolume mixer allowing 0.5 ms dead time and an x-ray observation cell.
We have recently re-commissioned our autosampler system that can provide
automated sample handling for systems that do not require inline size exclusion
chromatography. The system consists of a Sparks-Holland sample robot that is
used to select particular samples from 96 well plates (with temperature control)
and deliver them to a Hamilton Microlab ML560 dispenser system that can inject
them into the standard sample chamber. Labview based software controls the
sequence of operations required for unattended data acquisition including
cleaning the sample cell, loading samples, flowing samples and triggering
the CCD and recovering the sample after exposure.
