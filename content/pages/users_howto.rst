Guides and Tutorials

BioCAT supports a number of techniques for analysis of partially-ordered and
disordered biological materials. Below is a set of HOWTOs and other guides
and tutorials for experiments at the BioCAT facility. These are intended
both for new users as they design their experiments and for users at the
beamlines as they run their experiments.

These descriptions should help you to decide if our facility can support your
research. However, it is strongly recommended that---prior to visiting BioCAT---
you discuss your experiment with the `User Liaison <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_
for your technique after reading these descriptions. In this way, your experiment
can be tailored to our facility so that you spend less time assembling and
debugging your set-up and more time taking high-quality data.
