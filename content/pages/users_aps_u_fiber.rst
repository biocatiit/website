Overview
=====================================
The BioCAT 18ID beamline will be unavailable from April 17 2023 to summer/fall of
2024 due to the `APS-U dark period <{filename}/pages/users_aps_u.rst>`_. During 
that period we plan to offer the opportunity to perform a limited number of 
experiments on other synchrotron facilities.

BioCAT supported beamtime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every few months BioCAT will work with a different beamline to schedule about a 
week of time at the beamline. For muscle diffraction experiments, BioCAT will 
solicit interest from our users, help them plan the experiments, and BioCAT will 
submit a proposal on the user’s behalf to other facility for a contiguous block 
of time for ta selected set of experiments. A BioCAT scientist will travel to 
the facility during that block to help support our users’ experiments. We will 
also assist them after the experiment with data processing/analysis as needed. 
These experiments will be done at beamline BL4-2 at SSRL or at MacCHESS at CHESS.


If you want to know more about this BioCAT supported time at other facilities 
`contact Weikang Ma <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_.

Options for Fiber Diffraction at other facilities not supported by BioCAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General fiber diffraction experiments are supported at beamline BL4-2 at SSRL 
and the LiX beamline at NSLS II. Users interested in performing such experiments 
should contact beamline staff for procedures and submit proposals for beamtime 
through the SSRL and NSLS II proposal systems.

General notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   Other beamlines and the NIH are interested in tracking where BioCAT users
    go for beamtime during the APS-U dark period. In order to facilitate this,
    if you are a BioCAT user who is submitting a proposal at a beamline you
    haven’t used before we ask that you put "BioCAT" in the proposal title
    when submitting proposals to another facility (e.g. "Fiber diffraction
    experiments on XXX - BioCAT"). This will also help us provide more
    support for these experiments at these other facilities.

*   BioCAT currently does not plan to do time resolved experiments using our
    setup at any other beamline during the dark period, due to limitations of
    experimental capabilities at other beamlines and/or available beamtime.

It is possible to do both small angle and wide- angle fiber diffraction
experiments on BL4-2. The beamline is equipped with both a CCD based Rayonix
detector and a Pilatus 3 1M pixel array detector. Muscle diffraction experiments
will be done in collaboration with BioCAT staff in dedicated runs scheduled
well in advance. Individuals wishing to be considered for these runs should
contact Dr. Weikang Ma as early as possible. Individuals wishing to do fiber
crystallography experiments are encouraged to submit proposals through the
regular SSRL beamtime proposal system. These experiments will not be directly
supported by BioCAT staff but we are always happy to provide advice in
planning experiments.

It will not be feasible to perform experiments requiring live animals.
Experiments can be done using skinned muscle shipped on wet ice or
frozen tissue shipped on dry ice only.

BioCAT staff has performed experiments confirming feasibility of muscle
diffraction experiments on ID7A using their EIGER 4M pixel array detector.
Muscle diffraction experiments will be done in collaboration with BioCAT and
MacCHESS staff in dedicated runs scheduled well in advance. Individuals
wishing to be considered for these runs should contact Dr. Weikang Ma as
early as possible.

LiX supports general fiber diffraction applications systems including
scanning diffraction imaging, on partially ordered. People interested in doing
such experiments are encouraged to contact beamline staff directly to make
arrangements. Such experiments will not be directly supported by BioCAT
personnel but we are always happy to provide advice in planning experiments.
