                :h3:`Understanding Phase Separation Could Impact Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disease`

                Living cells are amazing little biochemical factories that conduct countless
                chemical reactions in a cellular soup packed with lipids, proteins, nucleic
                acids, and ions, keeping them all in their proper places at any given time.
                Cells maintain this organization even while carrying out complex tasks such
                as cell division, signaling, transcriptional regulation, and stress responses.
                One example of this is the careful management of stress granule formation, a
                process in which membraneless organelles transiently form to control the
                utilization of mRNA during stress. These granules form and disperse through
                reversible liquid-liquid phase transitions involving proteins and RNA in
                the granules. Recent research has demonstrated that RNA-binding proteins
                in these granules contain intrinsically disordered sequences, called
                prion-like low-complexity domains (PLCDs), that are critical to regulation
                of these reversible phase transitions. There is also mounting evidence that
                these transitions may be disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases, like
                amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which mutations in PLCD-containing
                proteins, such as hnRNPA1, have been implicated as a cause of the disease.
                Recent work that relied on data from BioCAT, and published in the
                journal Nature Chemistry aimed to learn more about how these phase
                transitions are regulated. These findings will provide important
                information about the causes of diseases like ALS.

                        :h4:`Targeting Cancer at the Level of DNA Expression`

                        The last 20 years have brought a revolution in targeted therapies for cancer.
                        Small-molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies that target a specific
                        aberrant protein in tumors have provided cancer patients with treatments
                        that are associated with fewer side effects and longer survival than
                        conventional chemotherapy. This has been, in large part, the result of
                        intensive research into the role of oncogenes in cancer development.
                        Oncogenes are normal cellular genes that have become mutated in such a
                        way that they aberrantly promote the uncontrolled cell growth seen in
                        cancer. They are often proteins involved in growth control or activation
                        of cellular signaling; inhibiting these mutated proteins has proven to be
                        effective in stopping the growth of many cancers. Research by a team from
                        the Brown Cancer Center at the University of Louisville in Kentucky using
                        BioCAT and published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research promises to extend
                        these treatment  possibilities to control these oncogenes at the gene expression
                        level. The work, based on the discovery that DNA in the promoter region of many
                        genes forms higher order structures that could provide unique druggable targets
                        for intervention, extends structural knowledge of the promoter regions of
                        three important oncogenes.

                        :h4:`Understanding the Structural Implications of Genetic Mutations in Heart-Muscle Disease`

                        Cardiomyopathies are diseases of the heart muscle in which the muscle of
                        the pumping chamber (ventricle) can become enlarged (dilated cardiomyopathy;
                        DCM) or thickened (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HCM), potentially leading
                        to heart failure. There are currently no effective treatments but the disease
                        often has a genetic component related to mutations in the heart muscle
                        proteins that are involved in muscle contraction, so some researchers have
                        focused their therapeutic development efforts on correcting these muscle
                        contraction problems based on the structural basis of the defect. A recent
                        study from a team of researchers using BioCAT employed humanized mouse models expressing
                        mutations observed in patients with HCM and DCM to evaluate the
                        structure-function relationships and the changes observed in cardiac
                        muscle contraction with these mutations. The work, published in the
                        Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
                        America, provides a deeper understanding of the effects of
                        cardiomyopathy-causing gene mutations on heart muscle contraction that
                        could lead to the development of new therapies for this potentially
                        life-threatening disease.

                :h3:`BioCAT Plans for the APS-U Dark Period`

                The APS will shut down on April 17, 2023 for a major year-long
                upgrade, the "APS-U" project. There will be no user access to the
                APS during this “dark period”. The APS plans to restart operations at the
                beginning of April, 2024, followed by several months of safety
                and technical commissioning at all beamlines. We anticipate that
                BioCAT will be unavailable for experiments from the end of April 2023
                until early summer 2024. During this ~14 month shutdown, we plan
                to help support experiments by our users at other beamlines,
                including sending BioCAT staff to other beamlines to help with
                some of the more complicated experiments.

                        BioCAT held its seventh BioSAXS training course from 6/21/22-6/24/22.
                        There were 36 remote participants and 8 instructors. The workshop was held
                        entirely online, via Zoom, for ~5 hours each day. Before the workshop
                        started, participants were able to mail samples to BioCAT for SAXS data collection.
                        This data was then sent to them, and they were able to analyze it as part of the
                        workshop.
