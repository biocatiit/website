.. alert:: BioCAT is able to run most experiments at this time. COVID-19 related
    projects will still be given priority on the beamline. Additionally, due to
    an Argonne-wide policy, no users are allowed on site so all experiments are
    done in a mail-in fashion in collaboration with a beamline scientist. If

                :h3:`Tarantula myosin interacting-heads motif explains tetanic and post-tetanic phosphorylation mechanisms`

                Striated muscle contraction involves sliding of actin thin filaments along
                myosin thick filaments, controlled by calcium through thin filament
                activation. In relaxed muscle, the two heads of myosin interact with each
                other on the filament surface to form the interacting-heads motif (IHM).
                A key question is how both heads are released from the surface to approach
                actin and produce force. We used time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction
                to study tarantula muscle before and after tetani. The patterns showed that
                the IHM is present in live relaxed muscle. Tetanic contraction produced
                only a very small backbone elongation, implying that mechanosensing -
                proposed in vertebrate muscle - is not of primary importance in tarantula.
                Rather, thick filament activation results from increases in myosin
                phosphorylation that release a fraction of heads to produce force, with
                the remainder staying in the ordered IHM configuration.

                        :h4:`Key Insights into an Inherited Muscle Disease`

                        The gene NEB encodes for the skeletal muscle protein nebulin. Mutations in NEB
                        cause the disease nemaline myopathy, which is one of the more common inherited
                        myopathies. Patients with this muscle disorder have muscle weakness in
                        multiple different parts of their body and can also experience difficulties with feeding
                        or breathing. Currently, there is no cure for nemaline myopathy and treatment options
                        are limited. A team of researchers from the University of Arizona and BioCAT
                        working to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this
                        skeletal muscle disorder, report a new mouse model of nemaline myopathy that exhibits
                        similar symptoms to those identified in human patients. Importantly,
                        the new mouse model of this disease can be used to test future therapeutics. Future
                        studies are warranted to determine if interventions can relieve disease symptoms in
                        these mice. If successful, such therapeutics could be used for improving the quality of
                        life in human patients.

                        :h4:`Uncovering Unique Structural Features in Protein Regions Associated with ALS`

                        Prion-like domains (PLDs) have become a topic of interest because
                        of their connection with a variety of debilitating brain diseases, such as amyotrophic
                        lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. In fact, mutations in PLDs of
                        some genes have been shown to cause neurodegenerative disease. A recent study using
                        data obtained at BioCAT completed a comprehensive biophysical investigation of
                        PLDs in the protein hnRNPA1 to uncover the major behavioral and structural
                        features of these domains. This meaningful work may lead to discoveries
                        that can help individuals living with such neurodegenerative diseases.
