    projects will still be given priority on the beamline. Additionally, due to
    an Argonne-wide policy, users are allowed on site on with special permission
    from the APS, so most experiments are done in a mail-in fashion in
    collaboration with a beamline scientist. If you are interested in beam

                :h3:`What Bacterial Pathogens Can Teach Us about Protein Folding`

                Protein folding is one of the fascinating unanswered questions in biology.
                How does an amino acid sequence that is unfolded when it leaves the
                ribosome manage to fold properly into a highly ordered, lightning-fast
                enzyme or sturdy structural protein? Why don’t all the proteins in the cell
                instead just stick to each other, aggregating into a big mess? A unique
                model system in bacteria may hold some of the answers to these questions.
                The system involves the study of what are termed autotransporter proteins.
                These proteins have a highly specialized protein folding process
                that  attracted the attention of a team of researchers who have
                used this bacterial system as a model to determine what allows these
                unique proteins to maintain their disordered state in the periplasm. The
                work includes studies carried out at BioCAT. The authors believe their
                work will provide important information toward understanding
                basic questions of protein folding and tests long-held theories
                about how this remarkable biological process works.

                        :h4:`Relaxation at the Molecular Level`

                        The molecular interactions between the proteins myosin and actin that
                        generate force during muscle contraction are some of the most well-studied
                        molecular interactions in biology. However, there are some congenital
                        skeletal muscle disorders and types of heart failure where relaxation of
                        the muscle, rather than the force generation part of the cycle, appears
                        to be the problem, and there are currently no available treatments that
                        affect relaxation specifically. Recent work conducted at BioCAT used a unique
                        transgenic mouse model, time-resolved small-angle x-ray diffraction, and
                        molecular dynamics simulations to discover more about how myosin and actin
                        interact during skeletal muscle relaxation. This research may help
                        identify new treatments for neuromuscular disorders associated with impaired
                        muscle relaxation kinetics.

                        :h4:`Understanding the Physiology of the Human Heart through the Study of Tarantula Muscles`

                        A research team has found an unlikely source of inspiration
                        for understanding how the human heart works and how we might design better
                        drugs for conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: tarantulas. The
                        source of nightmares for arachnophobes and the household pets for
                        arachnophiles are inspiring researchers to take new approaches to
                        understanding diseases that alter how heart muscle cells contract and relax.
                        But, before getting to the human heart, there is more to learn about the
                        physiology of tarantula muscles. The researchers set out to understand how
                        contractions in tarantula muscle cells are activated and why are muscle
                        twitches that follow a sustained muscle contraction (post-tetanic) more
                        forceful than those that don’t (pre-tetanic). Their results provide
                        evidence that phosphorylation, the chemical addition of a phosphoryl
                        group (PO3-) to an organic molecule, plays a key role in muscle activation
                        and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) in tarantula muscles.
