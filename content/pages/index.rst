.. alert:: BioCAT is now able to carry out research on any subject, not just
    COVID-19 related projects. However, COVID-19 related projects will still
    be given priority on the beamline. Additionally, due to an Argonne-wide
    policy, no users are allowed on site and we can run fewer experiments than
    usual. If you are interested in beam time please contact us.

                :h3:`Tarantula myosin interacting-heads motif explains tetanic and post-tetanic phosphorylation mechanisms`

                Striated muscle contraction involves sliding of actin thin filaments along
                myosin thick filaments, controlled by calcium through thin filament
                activation. In relaxed muscle, the two heads of myosin interact with each
                other on the filament surface to form the interacting-heads motif (IHM).
                A key question is how both heads are released from the surface to approach
                actin and produce force. We used time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction
                to study tarantula muscle before and after tetani. The patterns showed that
                the IHM is present in live relaxed muscle. Tetanic contraction produced
                only a very small backbone elongation, implying that mechanosensing -
                proposed in vertebrate muscle - is not of primary importance in tarantula.
                Rather, thick filament activation results from increases in myosin
                phosphorylation that release a fraction of heads to produce force, with
                the remainder staying in the ordered IHM configuration.

                        Nebulin is a giant protein that winds around the actin filaments in the
                        sarcomeres of skeletal muscle.  Mutations in the nebulin gene (NEB) cause
                        typical nemaline myopathy (NM), a muscle disorder characterized by muscle
                        weakness that are difficult to treat.  The authors of this study
                        created a mouse model that mimics the typical nebulin-based NM patient
                        with compound-heterozygous mutations. X-ray diffraction studies on the
                        BioCAT beamline 18ID provided a structural explanation for the muscle
                        weakness. This new Compound-Het mouse model will be useful for testing
                        experimental therapies for typical NM.

                        :h4:`How Prion-like domains Drive Liquid-Liquid Phase Transitions in Cells`

                        Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) provides a way for cells to create
                        membraneless micro-environments (“condensates”) that have been
                        proposed to be involved in diverse cellular processes including stress
                        responses, RNA splicing, mitosis, chromatin organization, and the
                        clustering of receptors at membranes. Proteins driving LLPS often contain
                        intrinsically disordered prion like domains (PLD’s) that appear to be
                        necessary and sufficient to produce LLPS. In a recent paper in
                        the journal Science, researchers used a combination of NMR,
                        multiscale simulations and Size Exclusion Chromatography SAXS
                        experiments at BioCAT to discover sequence features that determine
                        the phase behavior of PLD’s.
