                :h3:`New Resource for the Muscle Diffraction Community`

                BioCAT staff have just published a review article, `Ma & Irving, 2022 Int.
                J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23(6), 3052 <https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23063052>`_, on
                the use of small angle X-ray fiber diffraction for studying skeletal and
                cardiac muscle disease. The article consists of a guided tour of the
                various diffraction features that can be used to extract specific pieces
                of information that can be used to provide insights into the structural
                basis of pathology. The article also contains a comprehensive review of
                the literature reporting diffraction studies of muscle that illustrates
                how small angle fiber diffraction has increased our understanding of
                specific muscle diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated
                cardiomyopathy, and nemaline myopathy.

                        :h4:`What Bacterial Pathogens Can Teach Us about Protein Folding`

                        Protein folding is one of the fascinating unanswered questions in biology.
                        How does an amino acid sequence that is unfolded when it leaves the
                        ribosome manage to fold properly into a highly ordered, lightning-fast
                        enzyme or sturdy structural protein? Why don’t all the proteins in the cell
                        instead just stick to each other, aggregating into a big mess? A unique
                        model system in bacteria may hold some of the answers to these questions.
                        The system involves the study of what are termed autotransporter proteins.
                        These proteins have a highly specialized protein folding process
                        that  attracted the attention of a team of researchers who have
                        used this bacterial system as a model to determine what allows these
                        unique proteins to maintain their disordered state in the periplasm. The
                        work includes studies carried out at BioCAT. The authors believe their
                        work will provide important information toward understanding
                        basic questions of protein folding and tests long-held theories
                        about how this remarkable biological process works.

                        :h4:`Relaxation at the Molecular Level`

                        The molecular interactions between the proteins myosin and actin that
                        generate force during muscle contraction are some of the most well-studied
                        molecular interactions in biology. However, there are some congenital
                        skeletal muscle disorders and types of heart failure where relaxation of
                        the muscle, rather than the force generation part of the cycle, appears
                        to be the problem, and there are currently no available treatments that
                        affect relaxation specifically. Recent work conducted at BioCAT used a unique
                        transgenic mouse model, time-resolved small-angle x-ray diffraction, and
                        molecular dynamics simulations to discover more about how myosin and actin
                        interact during skeletal muscle relaxation. This research may help
                        identify new treatments for neuromuscular disorders associated with impaired
                        muscle relaxation kinetics.

                workshop June 21-24th. Participants will receive four
                days of virtual lectures and hands-on software tutorials on
                the basics of BioSAXS data collection and processing. They
                will also be able to mail samples to BioCAT for data collection
                prior to the workshop.

                        Starting April 17, 2023 the APS will be down for a year to undergo a major
                        upgrade, including rebuilding the accelerator and storage ring (“APS-U”).
                        BioCAT invites you to join us for a virtual town hall on March 15th to discuss
                        the impact of APS-U on BioCAT and our user community. The purpose of this town
                        hall is to provide an overview of the planned upgrade and its impact on, and
                        benefits for, the BioCAT community. We also will present our plans to facilitate
                        experiments for our users at other synchrotrons during the dark period. The
                        town hall will consist of short presentations by BioCAT staff followed by an
                        open-ended question and answer period.
