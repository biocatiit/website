                signals within the heart’s muscles known to impact the strength with
                which the heart contracts. This work not only solves a piece of the

                provides an avenue for targeted development of drugs to treat heart failure.</p>

                :h3:`Titin-Based Force Modulates Cardiac Thick and Thin Filaments`

                The Frank-Starling Law of the Heart states that the heart’s
                stroke volume increases with greater preload due to increased
                venous return, allowing the heart to adapt to varying
                circulatory demands. At the molecular level, increasing
                preload increases sarcomere length (SL), which alters
                structures w ithin the sarcomere that are correlated to
                increased calcium sensitivity upon activation. The titin
                protein, spanning the half-sarcomere acts as a spring in the
                I-band, applies a SL-dependent passive force on the myosin
                containing thick filaments changing its structure and
                functional properties. Altered titin-based forces play a
                crucial role in the etiology of many cardiomyopathies;
                however, the disease state obscures titin’s role, impeding
                therapeutic solutions. The authors studied titin’s specific
                role and concluded that reducing titin-based forces blunts
                structural changes in both thick and thin filaments while
                leaving the length-dependent OFF-to-ON transition mechanism
                intact, indicating a clear role for titin in the
                Frank-Starling mechanism.

                        :h4:`How hydrophobicity, side chains, and salt affect the dimensions of disordered proteins`

                        Understanding the driving forces behind stability of
                        denatured state ensembles (DSE’s) and intrinsically disordered
                        proteins (IDP’s) is central to a number of unresolved questions
                        in bimolecular thermodynamics regarding protein folding pathways
                        and foldability, thermodynamic stability, aggregation and
                        misfolding. Researchers at the University of Chicago and Notre
                        Dame used temperature-controlled size-exclusion
                        chromatography-coupled SAXS (SEC-SAXS) and NMR to examine how
                        temperature and solvent ionic strength influences the solution
                        structure(s) of the N-terminal domain of pertactin (PNt). PNt
                        is a valuable model system from a fundamental biophysical
                        point of view, as the full-length 539-residue pertactin folds
                        into a parallel β-helix but the 334 N-terminal residues do not
                        and instead behave as a highly expanded, intrinsically
                        disordered chain.

                        Muscle contraction is produced via the interaction of
                        myofilaments and is regulated so that muscle performance
                        matches demand. Myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a long
                        and flexible protein that is thought to control muscle
                        contraction via the regulation of myosin motors, as mutations
                        lead to debilitating disease. Here the authors used combination
                        of mechanics and small-angle X-ray diffraction to study the
                        effects of immediate and selective removal of the particular
                        domains of fast MyBP-C on sarcomere structure and function in
                        permeabilized skeletal muscle. They concluded that the MyBP-C
                        domains play an important role in contractile performance.

                Starting with the APS 2025-1 run next year BioCAT will be resuming user
                operations. After the long dark period for the APS upgrade (APS-U) project,
                we are very excited to be welcoming you back to the facility early next
                year. We also invite you to join us on January 10th at 1 pm CST for a virtual Town
                Hall where we will discuss the upgrade's effects on BioCAT, new capabilities
                that we've added during the dark period, and remind you about the process for
                getting beamtime at BioCAT.

                        BioCAT is offering its tenth intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS.
                        Students will have four days of virtual lectures and hands-on
                        software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS data collection and
                        processing from expert practitioners in the field. Students may
                        also be able to mail in samples for data collection on the BioCAT
                        beamline (Sector 18 at the APS) before the course, and there will
                        be time during the workshop to get help with analysis of their own
                        data. The course will take place from 12/10/24 to 12/13/24
                        and is entirely virtual (via Zoom).

                        The BioCAT team has been awarded $2 million in
                        supplementary funds from the NIH to upgrade the BioCAT
                        beamline. These funds will let us upgrade our x-ray optics (mostly original to
                        the beamline and more than 20 years old) to modern state-of-the-art
                        systems that can  take full advantage of the new upgraded APS source.
                        These new optics will provide smaller, more intense x-ray beams
                        and improved beam stability. The upgrade is expected to take ~2 years
                        to complete and user operations will continue unhindered while it is taking place.
