                :h3:`Unraveling folding pathways of dynamic DNA quadruplexes`

                G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-B form DNA structures containing genomic regions
                rich in guanine that sometimes fold into and often act as transcriptional
                regulators. They are frequently located at regulatory sites including promoters,
                replication origins and telomeres11. Understanding their folding pathways,
                while important to a fundamental understanding of form and function, has
                been challenging. G4 quadruplex folding pathways are distinct from not
                only proteins but also duplex RNA and DNA12. Previous work characterizing
                folding pathways using FRET, CD or stopped-flow absorbance suggested a
                complex, multi-step pathway. Researchers from the University of Louisville,
                some of whom are frequent BioCAT users, performed continuous-flow mixing
                time-resolved SAXS experiments to directly structurally characterize, for
                the first time, early steps in the G4 quadruplex folding pathway.

                        :h4:`A role for titin in residual force enhancement in skeletal muscle`

                        Residual force enhancement (RFE) is a property of skeletal muscle where
                        more force is produced after an active stretch than if it were simply
                        activated at the longer length.  This property is important for jumping,
                        locomotive, and stabilizing movements of the body. The molecular mechanism
                        underlying RFE is not well understood. In muscle, the protein titin
                        connects myofilaments and has been shown to
                        have many roles in sarcomere stability and modulating contraction.  The
                        authors of this study investigated titin's function during contraction using
                        small-angle X-ray diffraction of untreated WT mouse skeletal muscle and
                        muscle where 50%  of the titin was cleaved. They compared their results to
                        those obtained from mdm titin mutant mce that do not show residual force enhancement.

                        :h4:`Role of titin in the pathophysiology of diaphragm weakness during mechanical ventilation`

                        Diaphragm unloading during mechanical ventilation is an important clinical
                        problem. The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration and contracts during
                        each breath, thereby changing the anatomic configurations of the chest wall so
                        that air flows into the lungs. Increased diaphragm loading is associated with
                        diaphragm fiber contractile dysfunction, atrophy and injury. Whereas these
                        effects of increased loading on the diaphragm take months or years to develop,
                        the effects of decreased loading, as occurs when ICU patients are mechanically
                        ventilated, occur extremely rapidly, within hours. Not known is which
                        structures sense the mechanical unloading of the diaphragm
                        and set in motion the molecular cascades leading to atrophy. Here we test the
                        hypothesis that the mechano-sensor protein is titin, a giant elastic protein
                        connecting Z-disks and the thick filaments in the A-band.

                        We are pleased to announce the fourth BioCAT MuscleX symposium.
                        The symposium will feature an introductory
                        presentation on BioCAT's scientific missions, new capabilities enabled
                        by recent upgrades to the APS source and to the BioCAT beamline, and
                        a series of talks highlighting recent muscle studies utilizing X-ray
                        diffraction or other structural techniques.
                        The workshop will take place from 5/15/2025 to 5/16/2025 and will
                        be entirely virtual (via Zoom). A Zoom link will be provided to
                        registered participants at a later time, prior to the symposium.
