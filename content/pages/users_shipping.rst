Overview
********

At Argonne, shipping is a process that is highly focused on safety. Shipping things
improperly can incur fines exceeding $80,000 per day/ per offense.

Unforseen issues can often occur with shipping which could significantly hinder
your ability to conduct your experiment. It is recommended that you ship your
items 2-3 days **before** they are needed for your experiment.

To begin - please review the following websites, which address basic Argonne guidelines
for shipping samples, chemicals, and equipment:

*   `Shipping Samples and Equipment - An Introduction <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Safety-and-Training/Safety/Shipping/Shipping-Samples-and-Equipment-An-Introduction>`_
*   `Transporting Hazardous materials <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Safety-and-Training/Safety/Using-Material-Samples/Transporting-Hazardous-Materials>`_

It is highly recommended that you consult with your institution's shipping
coordinator (if you have one) regarding the legal ways to ship samples, buffers,
chemicals, specimens, and equipment to BioCAT. You may also consult with Argonne's
Shipping Department for advice regarding your shipment.

Shipping is a highly regulated activity by the US Department of Transportation
(DOT) and Argonne National Laboratory, which may also involve other government
agencies for approvals and permits to ship certain plant, animal, and human specimens,
as well as, any viruses, fungi, bacteria, etc. Additionally, the type of packaging needs to
be coordinated with the hazards associated with your shipment.

Some users prefer to transport materials by personal vehicle. Be advised that the same DOT
and Argonne Regulations apply to personal vehicle transport. There are also additional
regulations which you need to be aware of, most importantly **users are not allowed to
transport dry-ice in a personal vehicle.**

First Stage: ESAF Submission and Approval
*****************************************

The first stage in determining shipping requirements will be to `complete the
ESAF for your experiment. <https://www.bio.aps.anl.gov/pages/safety.html>`_
Under the 'Materials' Tab, you will list all of the samples, chemicals, buffers,
and commercial products (which contain chemicals) that you will be using during
the course of your experiment. Include all chemicals, even if you will be using
some which belong to BioCAT, which you will not be shipping. **Users are not
authorized to ship anything to BioCAT before their ESAF has been approved!**

Second Stage: Shipping Requirements
***********************************

Samples and Chemicals
=====================

Small quantities of chemicals found in buffers are usually okay to ship via
FedEx due to the DOT small quantity exemption rule - depending on hazard class
and quantity. Please refer to your MSDS and institutional shipping experts. Exceptions
to this are hazardous materials - ie. adding berylium to a buffer would make it a
hazardous material. Hazardous material inclusion have to be approved through
the ESAF associated with your experiment.

Bulk chemicals, however, often have associated hazards and packaging requirements
which require a shipping specialist. If your experiment will require bulk chemicals/
reagents, we recommend that you order those chemicals and have them shipped directly
to BioCAT from the vendor. It is often less expensive and time
consuming to leave bulk/ stock chemicals with us at BioCAT, so that you can access
them again when you come back to BioCAT for future experiments.

Temperature
===========

Temperature is also an important consideration for your package. 4 C packages may be shipped
with cold-packs, while frozen (-20/-80 C) packages will require dry-ice. Dry shippers are another means
of shipping samples at cryogenic temperatures.

At Argonne, dry-ice is considered a hazardous material. As such, the outer box must include
all relevant markings, and the container must conform to package requirements. You are
responsible for making sure packages are prepared properly. Argonne may also impose penalties
for improperly shipped items.

Samples
=======

Sample packaging is an important consideration.

## non-hazardous Animal Tissue

Non-hazardous animal tissues are those tissues which are being shipped with cold-packs and the shipment will not contain dry-ice.  The addition of dry-ice to any non-hazardous animal tissue sample shipment would render the shipment hazardous (because dry-ice is considered to be a hazardous material) and receiving would have to occur through building 46 as detailed below in the section 'dry-ice.'  

All non-hazardous animal tissue samples must be packaged using triple containment as detailed by `USPS Regulations:
<https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52apxc_024.htm>`_.

Equipment
=========

Equipment should be evaluated for it's ability to contain any 'stored energy.' Rechargeable batteries,
large storage capacitors, chemical components, or high-pressure potential needs to be explored
and mitigated where possible. Electrical equipment should be wrapped in plastic (in case the box gets
wet) and should be shipped separately from wet chemicals and chemicals that present a flammable hazard.

Third Stage: Shipping your items to BioCAT
******************************************

Please plan the arrival of your samples/materials needed for your experiment
at BioCAT carefully. You should send your samples such that they arrive a day or
two before the start day of your experiment - **on a business week day!**
It is not possible to receive packages at BioCAT on a weekend or holiday,
so samples may sit at room temperature for several days if they arrive on a
weekend or holiday.

If you would like to ship nonhazardous materials to BioCAT, you should ship to:

    | <Scientific Contact's Name> c/o Argonne National Lab
    | Bldg 435 Room B
    | 9700 South Cass Avenue
    | Lemont, IL 60439

Hazardous materials, **including any package with dry ice,** should be shipped to:

    | <Scientific Contact's Name> c/o Bldg 46, Haz Mat
    | Bldg 435 Room B
    | 9700 South Cass Avenue
    | Lemont, IL 60439

To prepare your package, please note that if you send a styrofoam container, it needs
to have an outer cardboard box or FedEx will return the package to you. All shipping
boxes should be labeled with the following on the outside of the box:

1.  The box should have a label that says 'PERISHABLE` if it contains perishable goods.
2.  You should write storage instructions on the outside of the package:
    Room temperature, 4 C (refrigerate), -20 C, or -80 C.
3.  Attach a shipping label, which is separate from the FedEx label with a
    sender address and phone number and a recipient address (which includes
    your Scientific Contact's name) with the extensions 2-0543 and 2-0540.

Inside the box, include:

1.  A detailed list of contents: a list of every sample, buffer, chemical, and
    other items that are in the box, so we can verify that we found it all.
2.  Storage instructions for every sample and buffer; and your contact
    information (including a phone a number we can reach you at if we have
    questions about the shipped items).
3.  Proper organization: do not toss a bunch of loose tubes in a cooler/ box.
    Use zip-lock bags, large conical tubes, freezer boxes, or other secondary
    containment to properly organize your shipment.
4.  Proper labeling: tubes labeled with lab tape or sticky labels can become
    unstuck when packaged with dry-ice. Use a Sharpie, lab-marker, or cold-resistant
    labels when shipping your samples with dry-ice.

The preferred method of shipping at Argonne is **FedEx Priority Overnight**. If you
want your samples to arrive promptly (the morning after shipping), you must
use this method. Otherwise they may arrive in the afternoon, or even later.

Please send the tracking information to your scientific contact once you ship
your package.


Final Stage: Shipping your items from BioCAT
********************************************

BioCAT does not have a budget for shipping users' samples and chemicals to or
from your home institution(s). It is highly recommended that you prepare your
own items for shipping back to your home institution upon completion of your
experiment. The preferred method of shipping at Argonne is FedEx. Please make
note of your FedEx account number before coming to BioCAT.

BioCAT does not supply freezer or refrigerator space for the long-term
storage of samples. Refrigerators and freezers are routinely purged of all User
samples. Therefore, if you would like to keep your samples you should prepare
them for shipment back to your home institution at the conclusion of your
experiment.

If you would like to ship materials to your home institution, you must:

*   Declare any chemicals, solvents, air cans, rechargeable batteries, etc. which are packed in the container.
*   Compile a list of these chemicals and amounts with paper copies links to the corresponding MSDS sheets.
*   Include your institution's FedEx Number and Internal Billing Reference.
*   Plan ahead for a complete inspection of package contents.
*   Consult with BioCAT Staff (Mark Vukonich) regarding finalization of
    shipping your packages back to your home institution.
