                <h3>How hydrophobicity, side chains, and salt affect the dimensions of disordered proteins</h3>
                <p>Understanding the driving forces behind stability of
                denatured state ensembles (DSE’s) and intrinsically disordered
                proteins (IDP’s) is central to a number of unresolved questions
                in bimolecular thermodynamics regarding protein folding pathways
                and foldability, thermodynamic stability, aggregation and
                misfolding. Researchers at the University of Chicago and Notre
                Dame used temperature-controlled size-exclusion
                chromatography-coupled SAXS (SEC-SAXS) and NMR to examine how
                temperature and solvent ionic strength influences the solution
                structure(s) of the N-terminal domain of pertactin (PNt). PNt
                is a valuable model system from a fundamental biophysical
                point of view, as the full-length 539-residue pertactin folds
                into a parallel β-helix but the 334 N-terminal residues do not
                and instead behave as a highly expanded, intrinsically
                disordered chain.</p>

                <h3>Titin-Based Force Modulates Cardiac Thick and Thin Filaments</h3>
                <p>The Frank-Starling Law of the Heart states that the heart’s
                stroke volume increases with greater preload due to increased
                venous return, allowing the heart to adapt to varying
                circulatory demands. At the molecular level, increasing
                preload increases sarcomere length (SL), which alters
                structures w ithin the sarcomere that are correlated to
                increased calcium sensitivity upon activation. The titin
                protein, spanning the half-sarcomere acts as a spring in the
                I-band, applies a SL-dependent passive force on the myosin
                containing thick filaments changing its structure and
                functional properties. Altered titin-based forces play a
                crucial role in the etiology of many cardiomyopathies;
                however, the disease state obscures titin’s role, impeding
                therapeutic solutions. The authors studied titin’s specific
                role and concluded that reducing titin-based forces blunts
                structural changes in both thick and thin filaments while
                leaving the length-dependent OFF-to-ON transition mechanism
                intact, indicating a clear role for titin in the
                Frank-Starling mechanism.</p>

                <p>Muscle contraction is produced via the interaction of
                myofilaments and is regulated so that muscle performance
                matches demand. Myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a long
                and flexible protein that is thought to control muscle
                contraction via the regulation of myosin motors, as mutations
                lead to debilitating disease. Here the authors used combination
                of mechanics and small-angle X-ray diffraction to study the
                effects of immediate and selective removal of the particular
                domains of fast MyBP-C on sarcomere structure and function in
                permeabilized skeletal muscle. They concluded that the MyBP-C

                <h3>Structural insights into the formation of repulsive netrin guidance complexes</h3>
                <p>Netrins are a conserved class of proteins involved in synaptic connectivity
                of the nervous system in bilaterian animals. They act as secreted guidance
                cues, with the unique ability to exert repulsive and attractive responses
                on growing axons. They are also known to be involved in cell proliferation,
                migration and differentiation, and are therefore targets for treating
                cancer and insulin resistance. During axon growth and cell migration, the
                presence of the receptor Uncoordinated-5 (UNC-5) on target cells results
                in repulsion. However, the exact mechanism involved in the induction of
                repulsive forces has been relatively unknown due to the lack of biochemical
                and structural information about these systems. Researchers at the
                University of Chicago and Stanford University, in collaboration with BioCAT
                staff, showed that UNC-5 is a heparin-binding protein, determined its
                structure bound to a heparin fragment, and could modulate UNC-5–heparin
                affinity using a directed evolution platform or structure-based rational
                design.</p>

                <h3>Myosin in autoinhibited off state(s), stabilized by mavacamten,
                can be recruited in response to inotropic interventions</h3>
                <p>Mavacamten is the first myosin-targeted small-molecule therapy approved
                by the Food and Drug Administration to treat obstructive hypertrophic
                cardiomyopathy by attenuating excessive myocardial sarcomere activity.
                Mavacamten regulates cardiac function at the sarcomere level by selectively
                but reversibly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of myosin. It shifts myosin
                toward ordered off states close to the thick filament backbone making them
                unavailable for binding to actin and generating force.  It is necessary,
                however for the heart to adjust its output to ensure sufficient cardiac
                output, especially during increased physiological demands. It was unknown
                whether mavacamten stabilized heads could still be recruited by the usual
                physiological inotropic mechanisms for the patient to be able to adapt to
                changing demands on their hearts. The authors of this study
                provided direct evidence the mavacamten-promoted off
                states of myosin in the thick filament are at least partially
                activable, thus preserving cardiac reserve mechanisms.</p>

                <h3>The structural OFF and ON states of myosin can be decoupled
                from the biochemical super- and disordered-relaxed states</h3>
                <p>Myosin-based thick-filament regulation is now known to be critical for
                muscle contraction with myosin dysregulation found in hypertrophic and
                dilated cardiomyopathies but many details of thick filament regulation
                remain to be discovered. Myosin ATPase assays have demonstrated that under
                relaxed conditions, myosin may reside either in a high-energy-consuming
                disordered-relaxed (DRX) state available for binding actin to generate
                force or in an energy-sparing super-relaxed (SRX) state unavailable for
                actin binding. X-ray diffraction studies have shown that the majority of
                myosin heads are in a quasi-helically ordered OFF state in a resting
                muscle and that this helical ordering is lost when myosin heads are turned
                ON for contraction. It has been assumed that myosin heads in SRX and DRX
                states are equivalent to the OFF and ON states. Our results show that
                biochemically defined SRX and DRX can be decoupled from structurally
                defined OFF and ON states.</p>

                Structure and Function of the BECN1 Intrinsically Disordered Region</h3>
                <p>Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that degrades
                un-needed cellular components such as misfolded, aggregated, mutated
                and damaged proteins, organelles, and pathogens. Autophagy dysfunction
                is implicated in numerous diseases including neurodegenerative disorders,
                muscular diseases, cardiomyopathy, cancer and infectious diseases. Many
                proteins involved in autophagy contain intrinsically disordered regions
                (IDRs) that do not form stable secondary or tertiary structure. The
                structural flexibility of IDRs is thought to enable diverse and multiple
                interactions enabling them to regulate cell signaling pathways. Many
                IDRs have been shown to fold upon binding to ligands. BECN1, a key
                autophagy protein involved in autophagosome nucleation, contains two
                invariant CxxC motifs within a large BECN1 intrinsically disordered
                region (IDR) at the BECN1 N-terminus. The goal of the research was to
                uncover the functional roles of the invariant CxxC motifs which were

                <h3>Surface-mediated spontaneous emulsification of the acylated peptide semaglutide</h3>
                <p>Semaglutide (SMG) is class of modified, acetylated
                peptide mimic commonly used as a commercial therapeutic
                to treat type-2 diabetes and obesity. Like other classes
                of peptide mimic therapeutics, SMG’s suffer from physical
                instabilities, including various aggregation and
                degradation pathways but also spontaneous emulsification
                into colloidal structures in the presence of certain
                hydrophobic surfaces, a process often termed “ouzo formation.”
                Researchers at the University of Delaware Center for Neutron
                Science, in collaboration with Eli Lilly, used a variety of
                biophysical methods including small-angle X-ray scattering
                (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) and dynamic light scattering

                cellular processes including stress response, protein
                degradation and gene expression. These condensates contain
                a wide range of unique macromolecules, but the drivers of
                this condensation, referred to as scaffolds, comprise only
                a very small fraction. The non-driver components are commonly
                referred to as ligands and may not phase separate on their own
                but nonetheless may help regulate assembly, disassembly and
                other material properties. One such ligand is ubiquitin (Ub)

                mechanism for the reading and interpretation of said Ub code

                University has worked towards understanding the molecular

                inherited diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system
                (PNS). Myelin protein zero (MPZ) is necessary for normal
                myelin structural and function comprises ~50% of all
                proteins in the PNS; mutations in MPZ account for around
                5% of CMT cases. The authors performed nuclear magnetic
                resonance spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering
                (SAXS) analysis on a region of this protein. They were
                able to correlate different types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
                disease symptoms to subregions within this protein.</p>

                <p>Right ventricular (RV) contractile dysfunction commonly

                with reduced ejection fraction and pulmonary hypertension

                may not reflect aspects of underlying myocyte dysfunction.
                To address the need for better diagnostics, the authors sought
                to characterize RV myocyte contractile depression in HFrEF-PH,

                signal transduction pathways that usually lack intrinsic
                enzymatic activity but instead facilitate the linking of

                <h3>Understanding Phase Separation Could Impact Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disease</h3>
                <p>Living cells are amazing little biochemical factories that
                conduct countless chemical reactions in a cellular soup packed
                with lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and ions, keeping them
                all in their proper places at any given time. Cells maintain
                this organization even while carrying out complex tasks such
                as cell division, signaling, transcriptional regulation, and
                stress responses. One example of this is the careful
                management of stress granule formation, a process in which
                membraneless organelles transiently form to control the
                utilization of mRNA during stress. These granules form and
                disperse through reversible liquid-liquid phase transitions
                involving proteins and RNA in the granules. Recent research
                has demonstrated that RNA-binding proteins in these granules
                contain intrinsically disordered sequences, called prion-like
                low-complexity domains (PLCDs), that are critical to regulation
                of these reversible phase transitions. There is also mounting
                evidence that these transitions may be disrupted in
                neurodegenerative diseases, like amyotrophic lateral
                sclerosis (ALS), in which mutations in PLCD-containing
                proteins, such as hnRNPA1, have been implicated as a cause
                of the disease. Recent work that relied on data gathered
                at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS),
                an Office of Science user facility at Argonne National
                Laboratory, and published in the journal Nature Chemistry
                aimed to learn more about how these phase transitions are
                regulated. These findings will provide important information

                <h3>Targeting Cancer at the Level of DNA Expression</h3>
                <p>The last 20 years have brought a revolution in targeted
                therapies for cancer. Small-molecule inhibitors and monoclonal
                antibodies that target a specific aberrant protein in tumors
                have provided cancer patients with treatments that are
                associated with fewer side effects and longer survival than
                conventional chemotherapy. This has been, in large part, the
                result of intensive research into the role of oncogenes in
                cancer development. Oncogenes are normal cellular genes that
                have become mutated in such a way that they aberrantly promote
                the uncontrolled cell growth seen in cancer. They are often
                proteins involved in growth control or activation of cellular
                signaling; inhibiting these mutated proteins has proven to be
                effective in stopping the growth of many cancers. Research by
                a team from the Brown Cancer Center at the University of
                Louisville in Kentucky using the U.S. Department of Energy’s
                Advanced Photon Source (APS) and published in the journal

                possibilities to control these oncogenes at the gene
                expression level. The work, based on the discovery that DNA
                in the promoter region of many genes forms higher order
                structures that could provide unique druggable targets for
                intervention, extends structural knowledge of the promoter
                regions of three important oncogenes.</p>

                <p>Cardiomyopathies are diseases of the heart muscle in which
                the muscle of the pumping chamber (ventricle) can become
                enlarged (dilated cardiomyopathy; DCM) or thickened
                (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HCM), potentially leading
                to heart failure. There are currently no effective
                treatments but the disease often has a genetic component
                related to mutations in the heart muscle proteins that are
                involved in muscle contraction, so some researchers have
                focused their therapeutic development efforts on correcting
                these muscle contraction problems based on the structural
                basis of the defect. A recent study from a team of researchers
                using the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source
                (APS) employed humanized mouse models expressing mutations
                observed in patients with HCM and DCM to evaluate the
                structure-function relationships and the changes observed in
                cardiac muscle contraction with these mutations. The work,
                published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
                of the United States of America, provides a deeper
                understanding of the effects of cardiomyopathy-causing gene
                mutations on heart muscle contraction that could lead to the

                <p>Protein folding is one of the fascinating unanswered questions in biology.
                    How does an amino acid sequence that is unfolded when it leaves the
                    ribosome manage to fold properly into a highly ordered, lightning-fast
                    enzyme or sturdy structural protein? Why don’t all the proteins in the cell
                    instead just stick to each other, aggregating into a big mess? A unique
                    model system in bacteria may hold some of the answers to these questions.
                    The system involves the study of what are termed autotransporter proteins.
                    These proteins have a highly specialized protein folding process
                    that  attracted the attention of a team of researchers who have
                    used this bacterial system as a model to determine what allows these
                    unique proteins to maintain their disordered state in the periplasm. The

                <p>The gene NEB encodes for the skeletal muscle protein nebulin. Mutations in NEB
                    cause the disease nemaline myopathy, which is one of the more common inherited
                    myopathies. Patients with this muscle disorder have muscle weakness in
                    multiple different parts of their body and can also experience difficulties with feeding
                    or breathing. Currently, there is no cure for nemaline myopathy and treatment options
                    are limited. A team of researchers from the University of Arizona and BioCAT
                    working to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this
                    skeletal muscle disorder, report a new mouse model of nemaline myopathy that exhibits
                    similar symptoms to those identified in human patients. Importantly,
                    the new mouse model of this disease can be used to test future therapeutics. Future
                    studies are warranted to determine if interventions can relieve disease symptoms in
                    these mice. If successful, such therapeutics could be used for improving the quality of
                    life in human patients.</p>

                  mutations in a single key enzyme result in the formation of insoluble glucan
                  inclusion bodies that cause neuronal death. Research conducted at two x-ray
                  beamlines at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS), an
                  Office of Science user facility at Argonne solved the structure of the enzyme
                  responsible, the laforin glucan phosphatase. The work has provided important
                  insights into both the basis of Lafora disease and normal glycogen metabolism.</p>

                <p>TAP binding protein, related (TAPbPr), a novel protein
                chaperone, plays a role in loading peptides onto major
                histocompatibility class i (mhc i) molecules during the

                the biochemical function of TAPbPr, comparing it with
                tapasin, another chaperone with a similar protein sequence.
                The results of this study could lead to ways to modulate

                <p>Flying insects are among the most successful species on our
                planet. Flight is very metabolically demanding and many insects
                have found a clever way to reduce energy costs in their flight
                muscles by employing a process called “stretch activation, which
                has been recognized since the 1960s as an interesting and
                physiologically important phenomenon, but a mechanistic explanation
                has been elusive. Now, research at BioCAT provides another,

                <h3>Packing It In: A New Look at Collagen Fibers</h3>
                <p>Nature uses collagen everywhere in constructing multicellular
                animals. There are at least 20 types of collagen, but 80-90% of
                the collagen in the body consists of types I, II, and III.
                Collagen type II makes up 50% of all cartilage protein, and
                is essential in normal formation of such structures as
                cartilage, the vitreous humor of the eye (the clear gel
                that fills the space between the lens and the retina of
                the eyeball of humans and other vertebrates), bones, and
                teeth. To create these structures, collagen molecules are
                positioned in arrays called fibrils, producing what are known
                as the D-periodic fibrillar collagens. Until now, technical
                limitations prevented accurate structural studies of collagen
                type II packing. A research team aided by the BioCAT 18- ID
                beamline and the BioCARS 14-BM-C beamline at the APS has
                remedied that situation by determining the molecular structure
                of collagen type II in living tissues.</p>

                Creutzfeldt-Jakob and bovine spongiform encephalopathy

                propagate a disease cycle just by changing its shape. A

                <h3>Getting to Know Cellulose</h3>
                <p>As humans continue to deplete the Earth’s supply of fossil fuels,

                as cornhusks left after harvest, is one such alternative energy
                source. Before efficient use can be made of such materials,
                understanding how to break down cellulose—the fiber in human
                nutrition and the main component of much biomass waste—is crucial.
                With the help of the NE-CAT and BioCAT beamlines at the APS and
                the SPring-8 (Japan) beamline BL38B1, an international research
                team from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of Tokyo,
                and the University of Grenoble has identified important new
                features of cellulose structure. Their work provides important
                new details that could be used in designing more efficient treatments
