                <p>Mutations in the gene PTPN11, which encodes a common enzyme
                called SHP2, can result in developmental disorders, such as
                Noonan Syndrome, and act as oncogenic drivers in patients with
                certain blood cancers. Due to the well understood role of the
                enzyme SHP2 in Noonan Syndrome and in tumorigenesis, many
                companies are currently trying to develop drugs that inhibit
                the enzyme. Researched investigated what impact mutations to
                SHP2 may have on the potential efficacy of drugs targeting
                this enzyme.</p>

                the biochemical function of TAPbPr, comparing it with
                tapasin, another chaperone with a similar protein sequence.
                The results of this study could lead to ways to modulate

                <h3>The Molecular Mechanism of Stretch Activation in Insect Muscle</h3>
                <p>Flying insects are among the most successful species on our
                planet. Flight is very metabolically demanding and many insects
                have found a clever way to reduce energy costs in their flight
                muscles by employing a process called “stretch activation, which
                has been recognized since the 1960s as an interesting and
                physiologically important phenomenon, but a mechanistic explanation
                has been elusive. Now, research at BioCAT provides another,
                important step toward a full explanation of stretch activation,
                which also plays an important role in mammalian cardiac
                expansion and contraction.</p>

                <h3>Packing It In: A New Look at Collagen Fibers</h3>
                <p>Nature uses collagen everywhere in constructing multicellular
                animals. There are at least 20 types of collagen, but 80-90% of
                the collagen in the body consists of types I, II, and III.
                Collagen type II makes up 50% of all cartilage protein, and
                is essential in normal formation of such structures as
                cartilage, the vitreous humor of the eye (the clear gel
                that fills the space between the lens and the retina of
                the eyeball of humans and other vertebrates), bones, and
                teeth. To create these structures, collagen molecules are
                positioned in arrays called fibrils, producing what are known
                as the D-periodic fibrillar collagens. Until now, technical
                limitations prevented accurate structural studies of collagen
                type II packing. A research team aided by the BioCAT 18- ID
                beamline and the BioCARS 14-BM-C beamline at the APS has
                remedied that situation by determining the molecular structure
                of collagen type II in living tissues.</p>

                <h3>The Power of Proteins: Prion Diseases Demystified</h3>
                <p>It is hard to believe that a single protein can be responsible
                for the damage inflicted by diseases such as human
                Creutzfeldt-Jakob and bovine spongiform encephalopathy
                (Mad Cow Disease). Yet the implicated protein, known as a
                prion and only about 200 amino acids long, can initiate and
                propagate a disease cycle just by changing its shape. A

                <h3>Getting to Know Cellulose</h3>
                <p>As humans continue to deplete the Earth’s supply of fossil fuels,
                finding new sources of energy becomes a priority. Biomass, such
                as cornhusks left after harvest, is one such alternative energy
                source. Before efficient use can be made of such materials,
                understanding how to break down cellulose—the fiber in human
                nutrition and the main component of much biomass waste—is crucial.
                With the help of the NE-CAT and BioCAT beamlines at the APS and
                the SPring-8 (Japan) beamline BL38B1, an international research
                team from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of Tokyo,
                and the University of Grenoble has identified important new
                features of cellulose structure. Their work provides important
                new details that could be used in designing more efficient treatments

                <p>Collagens—we might take them for granted, but without them

                cornea, or bones. In much the same way that wood is used to
                frame a house and form a structure for the overlying construction
                materials, collagens are proteins used in the framing of mammalian
                tissues, but gaining an accurate picture of their three-dimensional
                structure in the body has proven more difficult. Thanks to work
                by a research group based at the Illinois Institute of Technology
                and using the BioCAT 18-ID beamline at the APS, a complete structure
