                <h3>What Bacterial Pathogens Can Teach Us about Protein Folding</h3>
                <p>Protein folding is one of the fascinating unanswered questions in biology.
                    How does an amino acid sequence that is unfolded when it leaves the
                    ribosome manage to fold properly into a highly ordered, lightning-fast
                    enzyme or sturdy structural protein? Why don’t all the proteins in the cell
                    instead just stick to each other, aggregating into a big mess? A unique
                    model system in bacteria may hold some of the answers to these questions.
                    The system involves the study of what are termed autotransporter proteins.
                    These proteins have a highly specialized protein folding process
                    that  attracted the attention of a team of researchers who have
                    used this bacterial system as a model to determine what allows these
                    unique proteins to maintain their disordered state in the periplasm. The
                    work includes studies carried out at BioCAT. The authors believe their
                    work will provide important information toward understanding
                    basic questions of protein folding and tests long-held theories
                    about how this remarkable biological process works.</p>

                <h3>Relaxation at the Molecular Level</h3>
                <p>The molecular interactions between the proteins myosin and actin that
                    generate force during muscle contraction are some of the most well-studied
                    molecular interactions in biology. However, there are some congenital
                    skeletal muscle disorders and types of heart failure where relaxation of
                    the muscle, rather than the force generation part of the cycle, appears
                    to be the problem, and there are currently no available treatments that
                    affect relaxation specifically. Recent work conducted at BioCAT used a unique
                    transgenic mouse model, time-resolved small-angle x-ray diffraction, and
                    molecular dynamics simulations to discover more about how myosin and actin
                    interact during skeletal muscle relaxation. This research may help
                    identify new treatments for neuromuscular disorders associated with impaired
                    muscle relaxation kinetics.</p>

                <h3>Understanding the Physiology of the Human Heart through the Study of Tarantula Muscles</h3>
                <p>A research team has found an unlikely source of inspiration
                    for understanding how the human heart works and how we might design better
                    drugs for conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: tarantulas. The
                    source of nightmares for arachnophobes and the household pets for
                    arachnophiles are inspiring researchers to take new approaches to
                    understanding diseases that alter how heart muscle cells contract and relax.
                    But, before getting to the human heart, there is more to learn about the
                    physiology of tarantula muscles. The researchers set out to understand how
                    contractions in tarantula muscle cells are activated and why are muscle
                    twitches that follow a sustained muscle contraction (post-tetanic) more
                    forceful than those that don’t (pre-tetanic). Their results provide
                    evidence that phosphorylation, the chemical addition of a phosphoryl
                    group (PO3-) to an organic molecule, plays a key role in muscle activation
                    and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) in tarantula muscles.</p>

                <h3>Key Insights into an Inherited Muscle Disease</h3>
                <p>The gene NEB encodes for the skeletal muscle protein nebulin. Mutations in NEB
                    cause the disease nemaline myopathy, which is one of the more common inherited
                    myopathies. Patients with this muscle disorder have muscle weakness in
                    multiple different parts of their body and can also experience difficulties with feeding
                    or breathing. Currently, there is no cure for nemaline myopathy and treatment options
                    are limited. A team of researchers from the University of Arizona and BioCAT
                    working to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this
                    skeletal muscle disorder, report a new mouse model of nemaline myopathy that exhibits
                    similar symptoms to those identified in human patients. Importantly,
                    the new mouse model of this disease can be used to test future therapeutics. Future
                    studies are warranted to determine if interventions can relieve disease symptoms in
                    these mice. If successful, such therapeutics could be used for improving the quality of
                    life in human patients.</p>

                <h3>Sarcomere Structure and Nemaline Myopathy</h3>
                <p>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital non-dystrophic
                myopathies and is characterized by severe hypotonia, muscle weakness,
                feeding difficulties, respiratory failure, and the presence of nemaline
                bodies (rods) in skeletal muscle biopsies.  One form of nemaline myopathy
                is caused by mutations in the KBTBD13 (NEM6) gene. A combination of
                transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced muscle relaxation, muscle fiber-
                and sarcomere-contractility assays, super-resolution microscopy, and low
                angle X-ray diffraction at BioCAT revealed that the

                <h3>Cool Temperatures During Hibernation May Freeze Muscle Contraction to Save Energy</h3>
                <p>Striated muscle contraction is a highly regulated process that involves an
                  orchestrated series of events within the muscle’s contractile units, which
                  are also known as sarcomeres. In a recent study, researchers studied the
                  effect of low temperature on mammalian skeletal muscle contraction. They
                  found that cooler temperatures reduce force generation by trapping
                  filaments in the muscle sarcomeres in a refractory state that cannot
                  undergo contraction and utilize adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This

                <p>Traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is often referred to as the “invisible

                <p>Mutations in the gene PTPN11, which encodes a common enzyme
                called SHP2, can result in developmental disorders, such as
                Noonan Syndrome, and act as oncogenic drivers in patients with
                certain blood cancers. Due to the well understood role of the

                <h3>Lafora Disease: A Delicate Solubility Problem</h3>
                <p>Cells can store up to 55,000 glucose units in water-soluble spheres of branched, polymeric
                  glycogen. This provides ready energy for rapid response to cellular needs but
                  also must be managed carefully because too much glycogen accumulation can
                  activate programmed cell death. This is especially true of neurons, which
                  consume large amounts of glucose but are particularly sensitive to glycogen

                <h3>Packing It In: A New Look at Collagen Fibers</h3>
                <p>Nature uses collagen everywhere in constructing multicellular
                animals. There are at least 20 types of collagen, but 80-90% of
                the collagen in the body consists of types I, II, and III.
                Collagen type II makes up 50% of all cartilage protein, and
                is essential in normal formation of such structures as
                cartilage, the vitreous humor of the eye (the clear gel
                that fills the space between the lens and the retina of
                the eyeball of humans and other vertebrates), bones, and
                teeth. To create these structures, collagen molecules are
                positioned in arrays called fibrils, producing what are known
                as the D-periodic fibrillar collagens. Until now, technical
                limitations prevented accurate structural studies of collagen
                type II packing. A research team aided by the BioCAT 18- ID
