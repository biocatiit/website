APS-U and BioCAT
###############################################################################

:category: users
:slug: aps-u

The APS is now nearly 30 years old and badly needs a refit. The APS is scheduled
to shut down on April 17, 2023 to build an entirely new accelerator and storage
ring to replace the current APS ring and restart operations in April, 2024. This
new upgraded ring is referred to as the APS Upgrade or "APS-U". Once completed,
the new APS-U ring will provide about 100 times greater brightness than is
currently available. This will provide both increased flux and reduced beam
sizes for all APS beamlines, including BioCAT 18ID.

BioCAT user program during the shutdown
=========================================

The APS plans to shut down on April 17, 2023 and restart operations in April,
2024. After the restart there will be several months of safety and technical
commissioning before the beamline is available for first experiments. We
anticipate resuming user experiments in the summer/fall of 2024. There will be
no user access to the APS for x-ray experiments during this “Dark Period”.

SAXS experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the dark period, users are encouraged to make SAXS measurements at other bioSAXS
beamlines in the US. We will provide some BioCAT supported time at these facilities,
and users can also directly apply for beamtime with these facilities at any time.

Fiber diffraction experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have made arrangements with beamlines at the SSRL and MacCHESS to run user
experiments on their beamlines during this dark period. Users will be able to
apply for BioCAT supported time at these facilities using the normal proposal
mechanisms at these facilities. In order to reduce the burdens of staff at
these other beamlines, BioCAT scientists will help coordinate and plan these
experiments, and help users analyze data as appropriate. BioCAT staff will make
multiple trips to these facilities to help do specific kinds of experiments.
This will be particularly important for muscle diffraction experiments.

Benefits of APS-U for BioCAT users
=====================================

The new accelerator and storage ring (“APS-U”) will be built in the same
building as the existing APS, representing a $815 million upgrade. The new
accelerator design (multi-bend acromat) will reduce electron beam emittance
(source size x divergence) by a factor of 70 (primarily in the horizontal
direction) from its present value. By doubling the beam current (100 to
200 mA) this will also result in approximately twice the flux delivered to our
samples. More important for us is the much smaller electron beam source size.
The vertical X-ray beam size and divergence will be ~1/3 of what it is now in
normal running mode (brightness) and about the same in the timing mode of the
ring. The horizontal beam size, however, will be reduced by ~ 1/20 and the beam
divergence by ~1/4 of what it is now. The spot size of the focused beam with the
normal beamline optics, currently ~ 30 x 140 µm will go down to < 30 x 30 µm
(conservative) resulting in improved signal to noise in all experiments and
shorter minimum exposure times for time- resolved experiments. The more
symmetrical focused beam will result in higher quality X-ray fiber diffraction
patterns. We will likely be able to do time-resolved microfluidic SAXS using
the normal beamline optics making these experiments much easier to perform and
schedule. Microbeam experiments with our compound refractive lens (CRL) optics
will benefit from much greater flux densities and smaller focal spots (< 2 x 2
µm with the 1.8 m focal length CRL, < 0.5 x 0.5 µm with the -0.05 m focal length
CRL) enabling faster and higher spatial resolution micro-diffraction experiments
and new possibilities for SAXS with microfluidic mixers.

In addition to the gains from the synchrotron upgrade, BioCAT staff
will use this period to do refurbishments and improvements to the 18ID beamline
for improved user operation after the upgrade.

BioCAT APS-U Town Hall
===========================================================

In March 2022 BioCAT had a virtual town hall to discuss the APS-U and it's
impact on BioCAT. Videos and slides from that town hall are available here:
