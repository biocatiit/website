This provides instructions of how to collect SEC-MALS-SAXS data at the BioCAT beamline.
Before coming, please ensure that you've read up on how to
`plan your experiment <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_design.rst>`_
and that you've properly `prepared your samples <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_prepare.rst>`_.

Before data collection
=========================

#.  Every buffer you use for SEC-MALS-SAXS should be filtered and degassed.

#.  In SEC-MALS-SAXS experiments you should reserver ~50 mL of buffer
    in a falcon tube. This will be used for cleaning the sample loop, diluting samples,
    etc. It is convenient to not have to extract this from the larger buffer
    bottles.

#.  Every sample should be spun down for 10 minutes just before measurement.


Changing buffer
====================

To change buffer you must do two things. First, you need to equilibrate the
column in the new buffer. Second, you need to change the coflow buffer.

**IMPORTANT:** Never change directly from a buffer with salt to a storage solution
of 20% ethanol, or vice versa. This could cause salt to crash out of solution
and damage equipment. Always include a water equilibration step between those
types of solutions.


Changing buffer on the Agilent
-----------------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT:** Talk to a beamline scientist before changing buffer
on your own. In most SEC-MALS-SAXS experiments buffer changes are done by a
beamline scientist.

SEC-MALS-SAXS setup needs long equilibration (~6 h to overnight), which
precludes too many buffer exchanges during a single run. Please plan accordingly,
and discuss with a beamline scientist if you have questions.

Be sure to never change the flow rate by more than 0.1 mL/min every minute.

Be sure you purge the RI flow cell.

You will also need to change the coflow sheath buffer.


Changing coflow sheath buffer
-----------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT:** A beamline scientist should train you on how to change buffer
before you do it on your own.

Whenever the buffer is changed for a SEC-SAXS or SEC-MALS-SAXS experiment the
coflow sheath buffer also need to be changed. To do so:

#.  In the experiment control software, stop the coflow by clicking the "Stop Coflow"
    button.

#.  Uncap the new buffer. Remove the coflow buffer tubing from the current buffer.

#.  Remove the pierced cap from the current buffer and place it on the new buffer.
    If there are any drops of the old buffer on it, gently with the cap with a kimwipe.

    *   **IMPORTANT:** You may be using the same buffer bottle for the HPLC as the
        coflow sheath. If so, make sure to stop the HPLC before transferring the
        HPLC leads with the coflow leads.

#.  Over a waste beaker, rinse the tubing with water from a DI Water
    squirt bottle.

#.  Place the coflow buffer line in the new buffer.

#.  In the experiment control software, start the coflow by clicking the "Start Coflow"
    button.

The coflow sheath flow should be given ~10 minutes to equilibrate. If you are low on
buffer or doing a SEC-MALS-SAXS equilibration you can can then stop the sheath
flow while the rest of the system equilibrates. If you are doing a SEC-SAXS equilibration
and have plenty of buffer, BioCAT recommends leaving the sheath flow running
so that you can't forget to start it for your experiment.


Loading Sample
===================
**IMPORTANT:** A beamline scientist should train you on how to load sample
before you do it on your own.

Immediately before loading a sample you should spin down the sample for 10 minutes.

The Agilent systems use the vial autosampler to load sample, rather than an
injection port. This means that multiple samples can be prepared at once,
and run in short succession without opening the hutch, if so desired.

#.  Load sample volume + 50 ÂµL into an autosampler vial.

#.  Put the vial in the autosampler tray. Take note of the position in the tray
    and the tray number.

    *   Typically the positions used are those closest to the autosampler door
        and farthest from the needle home position in tray 1. For example vial
        position A1.


Set up data collection
========================

Setting methods for the Agilent and Wyatt
-----------------------------------------------------------

Setting exposure parameters
----------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT:** A beamline scientist should train you on how to set exposure
parameters before you do it on your own.

To set exposure parameters in the BioCAT control software:

#.  Make a new folder for your sample by clicking on the folder button.
    It will be contained within your top level directory (should match all
    other top level directory names, such as 20190430Hopkins for a user
    group with PI Hopkins on 04/30/2019). Name the folder consistent with
    the sample identification in the FPLC/HPLC method.

    *   The BioCAT default for a sample name is PI initials plus sample number
        (starting at 1 and incrementing with each sample, for example
        JH1 for the first sample of a group with PI with initials JH).

    .. image:: {static}/images/how_tos/control_new_folder.png
        :class: img-rounded

#.  Change the filename to the new sample name. This should be consistent with
    the folder name and with the sample identification in the FPLC/HPLC methods.

    *   The BioCAT default for a sample name is PI initials plus sample number
        (starting at 1 and incrementing with each sample, for example
        JH1 for the first sample of a group with PI with initials JH).

#.  Set the exposure time and exposure period appropriately. The defaults that
    most users will want to use are 1 s and 2 s for time and period respectively.

    *   Note: You will usually not need to change this. Check anyways just to
        to be sure.

#.  Set the number of frames appropriately. The default most users will want to
    use is 1800. verify that frames*exposure period is equal to or greater than
    the run time of your FPLC/HPLC method.

    .. image:: {static}/images/how_tos/control_exp_params.png
        :class: img-rounded

#.  Set the "LC Flow Rate" to the flow rate of your method. If coflow is on
    click the "Change Flow Rate" button.

    *   Note: You will usually not need to change this.

    .. image:: {static}/images/how_tos/control_coflow_flow_rate.png
        :class: img-rounded

#.  If coflow is off click the "Start Coflow" button.

        :class: img-rounded


If you're not sure what any of the above parameters should be, contact your
beamline scientist.

Your exposure parameters are now set. You're ready to start your data collection.


Start data collection
========================

Starting data collection is now simple.

First

Then wait until a predetermined time and click the "Start Exposure" button.
How long you wait depends on the column you are using, but generally speaking
you should start the exposure just after the sample is injected. Talk to
your beamline scientist for more guidance with your particular experiment.

    :class: img-rounded

At this point you should also start on-line processing of the SAXS data.

Monitor the progress of the elution and the SAXS data to ensure nothing unexpected
occurs during your run.


End data collection
========================

The data collection will naturally end when your HPLC methods end and when
your exposures end. If you are certain that you have collected all of the
data (i.e. everything of interest has eluted and passed through the SAXS cell
and the SAXS intensity has returned to baseline) you can end your data
collection early. To do this, press the "Stop Exposure" button in the exposure
control software.

    :class: img-rounded

If everything has eluted from the injection (including any salt or other small
molecules) you can also stop the HPLC method. Only do this if you are
certain that everything has eluted, otherwise let it run the full 1-1.5 CV.

To do so


Optimizing your time
========================

There are several things to keep in mind to help you optimize your time:

*   Buffer changes on either instrument, but particularly the SEC-MALS-SAXS,
    take a lot of time. Optimize by combining samples into the same buffer
    as much as possible. Also make sure you know what experiments you're doing
    in which buffer and do them all at once so you don't have to re-equilibrate.

*   If you are doing both SEC-SAXS and SEC-MALS-SAXS, you can do one or the other
    while equilibrating the other system. A typical sequence might be:

    *   Equilibrate one or both of the SEC-MALS-SAXS systems overnight.

    *   In the morning at the start of your beamtime start to equilibrate the
        SEC-SAXS system.

    *   Collect data on one or both of the SEC-MALS-SAXS systems.

    *   Start those systems equilibrating.

    *   Switch to the SEC-SAXS system and run samples.

    *   Switch back to the SEC-MALS-SAXS systems.

*   Groups with a lot of buffer changes can pre-equilibrate columns off-line
    on our preparative FPLC while running experiments on the AKTA.

*   You should start spinning down your next sample with ~10-15 minutes left
    in your current run. This means starting to prepare any dilutions necessary
    as soon as you've started data collection on your current sample.

*   If you're sure all of the injection, including small molecules has eluted,
    you can stop your data collection early. Many users are able to stop data
    collection after 1 CV, and don't need the entire 1.5 CV elution to clear
    the column.

*   If you are using the SEC-MALS-SAXS instrument, once you have stopped the SAXS
    data collection you can load your next sample into the autosampler without
    waiting for the HPLC run to finish.

Collection Workflow
=====================

*   Switching buffer/equilibration

    *   SEC-MALS-SAXS setup needs long equilibration (~6 h to overnight), which
        precludes too many buffer exchanges during a single run.

    *   Split buffer in half so both inlet A and B can pump buffer. Be prepared
        for enough buffer and bring them in two bottles in advance. 2L is
        usually sufficient.

    *   Change flow rate by 0.1 ml/min about every minute (after pressure levels
        out) as you stop the flow of one buffer and begin the flow of a new buffer.

    *   Once back up to 0.8-1 ml/min, equilibrate for at least 6 more hours.

    *   If equilibrating overnight, we can equilibrate at a lower speed overnight
        (0.2 ml/min) and ramp up to operational flow-speed 2 hours before the experiment).
        For 6 hr equilibration, ramp up to operational flow speed (0.8-1 ml/min)
        right at the beginning.

    *   Make sure you clean the flow cell for the Optilab - T-rEX in between buffers,
        especially if there's more glycerol etc (anything that could change
        refractive index) - this requires the "purge" button on the LED panel to be switched on.

    *   ALSO: keep glycerol concentrations as low as possible (preferably <5%).

*   Injecting sample and starting HPLC run

    *   Have samples ready (concentrate or dilute to appropriate concentration
        and spin down 10-15 minutes) so that near the end of one run you can

        #.  Have the auto-sampler inject your sample just as the next run is
            about to start

    *   Each run should be about done after ~30 min (may vary based on sample elution
        profile and flow rate and usually signified by the integrated scattering
        intensity coming back to baseline levels) - stop collecting SAXS data
        then and you will have 5 min to put the new sample
        in the sample tray

        *   If you think you will be running late, time can be extended

        *   To change time, right click in Quat. pump, select Method, change time

    *   Preparing your sample

        *   Samples are injected from vials. 250 - 350 Âµl will be injected, but
            fill vials to ~50 Âµl more than the injection volume (900 Âµl is the upper
            limit).

    *   Loading your sample

        *   At the beginning of each new sample set, set a program for that sample set

            *   In ASTRA (Wyatt's MALS software):

                *   Create new sequence file, type number of samples and name them

                *   Set the sample property 1) name, 2) choose method (MALS-dRI-SAXS),
                    3) set time (18-23 mins depending on flow rate) for each sample

            *   In Chemstation (Agilent's HPLC software):

                *   Use the sample entry window to select positions in sample tray and name them

                *   Set the method SEC_constflow for each sample

                *   Make sure the sample volume is appropriate and make necessary changes before starting the program.

        *   For each sample, put the vial in the proper position in the tray
            for that sample.

        *   Watch the autosampler pick up the vial, aspirate the sample, and
            replace the vial

        *   Once the vial has been replaced and the robot moves out of the way,
            remove the vial and check that a reasonable amount of sample has been
            aspirated to ensure proper functioning of the autosampler. Begin
            station search (make sure capillary has been cleaned and is hooked
            back up to HPLC)

    *   Data from HPLC runs are saved in pre-determined folder (usually date followed by PI last name).
