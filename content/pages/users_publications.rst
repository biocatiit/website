Publications resulting for your research

When you publish using data from BioCAT you need to:

*   Use the proper acknowledgment of the APS and BioCAT
*   Notify both the `APS <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Science/Publications>`_
    and `BioCAT <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ of such publications.

Peer-reviewed publications are the primary measure of scientific output.
Properly documented publications insure that funds are available to continue
operating the BioCAT facility.

The BioCAT facility is supported by the `National Institutes of Health <https://www.nih.gov/>`_
and, by law, all publications resulting from NIH support must adhere to the
`NIH public access policy <https://publicaccess.nih.gov/>`_:

    All final, peer-reviewed manuscripts must be posted to the `NIH Manuscript
    Submission System <http://www.nihms.nih.gov/>`_ upon acceptance for publication and
    be made publicly available on `PubMed Central <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/>`_
    no later than twelve months after the official date of publication.

    To comply, go to the `NIH Manuscript Submission System web page <https://publicaccess.nih.gov/>`_
    and follow their instructions. You will need to link your submission to a
    source of NIH funding. If you do not receive additional NIH support, you
    must attach your submission to the BioCAT grant: P30 GM138395 Thomas C. Irving PI.

In addition to the above, publications resulting from work performed at BioCAT are
required to display the following acknowledgments:

    This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department
    of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office
    of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.
    BioCAT was supported by grant P30 GM138395 from the National Institute
    of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.

If you used the Pilatus 3 1M to acquire your data, please add the following:

    Use of the Pilatus 3 1M detector was provided by grant 1S10OD018090 from NIGMS.

This section should be added to the very end of acknowledgment:

    The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily
    reflect the official views of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
    or the National Institutes of Health.

For work done at BioCAT entirely before 2021 please replace the grant number
in the above acknowledgements (P30 GM138395) with P41 GM103622.
