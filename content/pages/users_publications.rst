Publications resulting for your research

Peer-reviewed publications are the primary measure of scientific output.
Properly documented publications insure that funds are available to continue
operating the BioCAT facility. You need to do 4 things when publishing
results from BioCAT:

#.  All final, peer-reviewed manuscripts must comply with the `NIH public
    access policy <https://sharing.nih.gov/public-access-policy>`_ upon acceptance
    for publication and be made publicly available on `PubMed
    Central <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/>`_ no later than twelve months
    after the official date of publication. To comply, follow the `Pubmed
    sumission guidelines <https://sharing.nih.gov/public-access-policy/submitting-to-pubmed-central>`_.
    You will need to link your submission
    to a source of NIH funding. If you do not receive additional NIH
    support, you must attach your submission to the BioCAT grant:
    P30 GM138395 Thomas C. Irving PI.

#.  Publications resulting from work performed at BioCAT are required
    to include the following acknowledgements:

    This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S.
    Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated
    for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under
    Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357. BioCAT was supported by grant P30 GM138395
    from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National
    Institutes of Health. ................ *<add at end of acknowledgements>*
    The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not
    necessarily reflect the official views of the National Institute of
    General Medical Sciences or the National Institutes of Health.

    *   If you used the Pilatus 3 1M to acquire your data, please add the following:

        Use of the Pilatus 3 1M detector was provided by grant 1S10OD018090 from NIGMS.

    *   For work done at BioCAT entirely before 2021 please replace the grant
        number in the above acknowledgements (P30 GM138395) with P41 GM103622.

#.  All BioCAT users must follow all applicable `NIH data sharing
    policies <https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy>`_.
    You the user, not BioCAT, are responsible for sharing and long-term
    storage of data from BioCAT in accordance with both the NIH policies
    and any other data sharing plans from your other funding sources.

#.  Notify both the `APS <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Science/Publications>`_
    and `BioCAT <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ of such publications.
