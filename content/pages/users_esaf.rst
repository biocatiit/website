As a PI/experimenter who has been awarded time to conduct an experiment
at BioCAT, you are responsible for filling out and submitting all of the
Safety Paperwork for your experiment at least **2-full weeks before your
experiment is set to begin.**

The `ESAF <http://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/esaf0001.start_page>`_ (Experiment
Safety Assessment Form) is the primary piece of paperwork that the APS uses to
verify the safety envelope of your experiment, and so it needs to be completed
and submitted well ahead of your experimental start date.

The PI is also responsible for notifying their staff who will be visiting BioCAT
to take all of the core Safety Courses required by the Argonne/APS Safety
Oversight Committee. There are times when the Users have difficulty, for one
reason or another, accessing the APS Safety Courses Web Portal. In cases like
this, you may take them when you arrive at the APS/BioCAT, but do understand
that this will delay the participation of those people not fully trained and
could delay the start of your experiment.

It is the responsibility of the PI/Spokesperson to see that these items are done.
Although, they may delegate the responsibility to a member of their staff.

Please email the `BioCAT Safety Officer <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ if
you have any questions regarding the ESAF or APS Safety Training.

Some important things to note/commonly confused items:

*   Descriptions must be detailed and complete for the *'Description'* and *'Lab Use'*
    tabs of the ESAF.
*   You must declare any electrical equipment that you will be bringing to the
    APS as part of the proposed experiment. On the *‘Equipment Tab’* of the ESAF
    click *‘Bringing to APS’* and Electrical if this applies to you and then
    choose any Tab at the top of the page to force the *'Electrical Inspection'*
    tab to appear. If you are bringing modified NRTL or non-NRTL equipment or
    unsure NRTL check the appropriate boxes and fill in the *'List equipment
    that will require an inspection'*.
*   If you are a mail-in User for SAXS, you cannot select yourself as the
    *'OS'* (On-site Spokesperson). You must add Srinivas Chakravarthy to your
    ESAF as an experimenter and make him the OS.
*   On the *'Materials Tab'* near the bottom-half of the web-page there is the question
    'Will you require to use beamline laboratory facilities to prepare samples or
    perform other work?' click 'Yes" if you intend on using our Wet-Lab to prepare
    your samples. A *'Lab Use'* tab will then be generated, which should be filled out.
*   If you intend on bringing anyone from a foreign country to the APS you must begin
    the User application process 6 weeks in advance to make a time allowance for the
    Security Background Checks/Approvals needed, if they are not currently an active
    User at the APS.
*   Please verify the completeness of your data before hitting the *'Submit'* Button.
