Overview
============

As a PI/Spokesperson who has been awarded time to conduct an experiment
at BioCAT, you are responsible for filling out and submitting all of the
Safety Paperwork for your experiment sufficiently far in advance of
the experiment (see the deadline section below). We recommend submission before these
hard deadlines so any issues can be resolved and your experiment can proceed
as planned.

The `ESAF <https://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/esaf0001.start_page>`_ (Experiment
Safety Assessment Form) is the primary piece of paperwork that the APS uses to
verify the safety envelope of your experiment, and so it needs to be completed
and submitted well ahead of your experimental start date.

The PI/Spokesperson is also responsible for notifying their staff who will be visiting BioCAT
to take all of the core Safety Courses required by the Argonne/APS Safety
Oversight Committee. There are times when the Users have difficulty, for one
reason or another, accessing the APS Safety Courses Web Portal.  In cases like
this, you may take them when you arrive at the APS/BioCAT, but do understand
that this will delay the participation of those people not fully trained and
could delay the start of your experiment.

Please email the `BioCAT Safety Officer <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ , Mark Vukonich, if
you have any questions regarding the ESAF or APS Safety Training.


ESAF Deadline
================

**Argonne is currently enforcing hard-cutoff intervals with
respect to the timing of the ESAF final submission dates.  The cutoff is timed
according to the experiment Start Date.**

*   There is currently a two-week (14 day) hard-cutoff for ESAF submissions
    for *on-site* experiments.
*   There is currently a one-week (7 day) hard-cutoff for ESAF submissions
    for *mail-in* experiments.

ESAFs submitted after these cutoff intervals will be not be approved by the APS
and the experiment will not be allowed to proceed.  ESAFs must be submitted in
their entirety by these interval cutoffs – without any missing information.

If your ESAF involves any of the additional hazards listed below
it will require a more detailed (and, therefore, prolonged) review
before access can be granted, so you should submit it at least 1 month before
your experiment:

*   `Bio-Hazardous Materials <https://www.anl.gov/safety/biosafety>`_

    Experiments utilizing any of the following items will have to be coordinated far
    in advance with your Scientific Contact, Mark Vukonich (BioCAT BSO), and Nena Moonier
    (APS BSO) to be reviewed formally by the ANL Institutional Biosafety Committee(IBC)
    as well as the IIT IBC:

    *   Human tissues or fluids
    *   Animal tissues derived from diseased animals
    *   Some plants and plant pathogens
    *   Some viruses and bacteria
    *   Some proteins which may be involved in causing disease or harmful effects of
        the disease process
    *   Some sequences of DNA or RNA

    The IBCs oversee the safety of all experimental participants and ratify the proposed
    experimental protocol according to Centers for Disease Control, Department of Transportation,
    and Department of Agriculture regulations. This is a process which can take upwards of
    three months; so consult with your Scientific Contact for IBC application instructions
    well in advance if you think your experiment might require the approval of the IBC.

*   `Lasers <{filename}/pages/users_lasers.rst>`_

    Use of any other than a class I laser requires additional ANL-supplied training. You
    will need to schedule a few hours to complete this training. In addition, use of a
    class IIIb or IV laser will require a written Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and
    an on-site review of the assembled (but not aligned) laser system before work may
    begin. A class IV laser will require all operators to have an ANL-approved off-site
    eye examination.

*   `Electrical Equipment <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Safety-and-Training/Safety/Electrical-Safety>`_

    All electrical equipment which is not certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing
    Laboratory (NRTL) (such as Underwriters Laboratories) or is modified will need to be
    inspected before it may be used at the APS. A listing of approved NRTLs is
    `provided here <https://www.osha.gov/dts/otpca/nrtl/>`_.

ESAF Instructions
======================

Below are instructions for filling out and submitting the ESAF. Please remember
to fill out *ALL* Tabs of the ESAF!

Description Tab
----------------------

This tab should contain a short abstract of the experiment that
you wish to perform at BioCAT, the associated hazards, and how you will
mitigate those hazards.

Experimenters Tab
------------------------

This tab must include a full list of people collaborating on
the experiment.

*   The three user categories that you have to choose from are:

    #.  *Mail-in* - A user who will be shipping their samples and buffers to
        BioCAT.  The experiment will be conducted by one of our Scientific Staff.
        No one from your group will be attending the beamtime experiment in-person.

    #.  *Off-site/Co-proposer* - A user who is a collaborator, but this person
        has not been directly involved in the sample preparation or other aspects of
        the experiment.

    #.  *Onsite* ->  A user who plans on being at BioCAT for the duration of
        their experiment to actively participate in the preparation and
        data-collection process.

*   If you intend on bringing any non-US Citizen to the APS, you must begin
    the User application process several weeks in advance to make a time allowance for the
    Security Background Checks/Approvals needed, if they are not currently an active
    User at the APS.

*   On this tab choose a Spokesperson (SP) for this experiment. This will be the user
    who has prepared the ESAF and can personally verify that all information
    contained therein is accurate and true.

*   If you will be a Mail-in user (note: BioCAT does currently support Remote-User experiments)
    you must electronically sign the ESAF on the 'Experimenters' Tab to
    personally verify that the statements and Materials declared in your
    ESAF are correct - there will be a link in the top third of the page that
    says, in red: "An Electronic Signature is required for this ESAF.
    A person designated as an "SP" must provide the signature.  Click to
    provide the Signature."


Materials Tab
---------------------

This tab should contain a complete list of the buffers, chemicals, and samples
which you intend on bringing or shipping to BioCAT.

Concerning the transport of chemicals – all chemicals must be transported or
shipped according to the Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulations.
This is best achieved by consulting with the shipping department of your
home institution so that they may ship the chemicals according to the hazards
that they present.  Alternatively, chemicals needed in larger quantities which
have an associated hazard may be purchased and shipped directly to BioCAT for your
use while conducting the experiment. See our `shipping page <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_
for more details.


*   When listing materials, samples names must be written out in full and (when
    appropriate) the expression system must be included. You should not use
    abbreviations with the exception of "DNA" and "RNA", and sample names
    should be written as, e.g., "Lysozyme from Chicken Egg White" rather than
    "Sample 1".

*   Near the bottom-half of the page there is the question "Will you require to
    use beamline laboratory facilities to prepare samples or perform other work?"
    Select "Y" if you intend on using our facilities to prepare
    your samples. Click on any other tab in the ESAF. A "Lab Use" tab will then
    be generated, which should be filled out.


Equipment Tab
-----------------

List any equipment you will be brining to or using at the beamline on this tab.

If you plan on bringing any electronics to be used in your experiment
(other than personal computers) check the "Electrical Equipment"
Box and the corresponding "Bringing to APS"'" box in to schedule an electrical
inspection. Click on any other tab in the ESAF. A "Electrical Inspection" tab
will appear, which should be filled out.

Electrical Inspection Tab
----------------------------

Contact the `BioCAT Electrical Safety Officer <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ ,
Rick Heurich, if you are bringing any electrical equipment. He will help you
figure out if it needs inspection or not.

If you are bringing modified NRTL or non-NRTL equipment or unsure NRTL check
the appropriate boxes and fill in the "List equipment that will require an inspection".

Submit the ESAF
-----------------

Please verify the completeness of your data before hitting the "Submit" button.
