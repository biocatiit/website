As a PI/experimenter who has been awarded time to conduct an experiment
at BioCAT, you are responsible for filling out and submitting all of the
Safety Paperwork for your experiment at least **2-full weeks before your
experiment is set to begin.**

The `ESAF <https://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/esaf0001.start_page>`_ (Experiment
Safety Assessment Form) is the primary piece of paperwork that the APS uses to
verify the safety envelope of your experiment, and so it needs to be completed
and submitted well ahead of your experimental start date.

The PI is also responsible for notifying their staff who will be visiting BioCAT
to take all of the core Safety Courses required by the Argonne/APS Safety
Oversight Committee. There are times when the Users have difficulty, for one
reason or another, accessing the APS Safety Courses Web Portal.  In cases like
this, you may take them when you arrive at the APS/BioCAT, but do understand
that this will delay the participation of those people not fully trained and
could delay the start of your experiment.

It is the responsibility of the PI/Spokesperson to see that these items are done.
Although, they may delegate the responsibility to a member of their staff.

Please email the `BioCAT Safety Officer <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ , Mark Vukonich, if
you have any questions regarding the ESAF or APS Safety Training.

There are new rules which have taken effect at the APS concerning the timely submission of the ESAF form:

*Please note that Argonne is currently enforcing hard-cutoff intervals with respect to the timing of the ESAF final submission dates.  The cutoff is timed according to the experiment Start Date.*
    1) there is currently a two-week(14 day) hard-cutoff for ESAF submissions if you wish to come *Onsite* for your experiment at BioCAT.
    2) there is currently a one-week(7 day) hard-cutoff for ESAF submissions for *Mail-in* experiments.

ESAFs submitted after these cutoff intervals will be rejected and the experiment will not be allowed to proceed.  ESAFs must be submitted in their entirety by these interval cutoffs – without any missing information.

Instructions for filling out and submitting the ESAF Form
Please remember to fill out *ALL* Tabs of the ESAF!

**-> The 'Description' Tab should contain a short abstract of the experiment that you wish to perform at BioCAT, the associated hazards, and how you will mitigate those hazards.**

**-> The ‘Experimenters’ Tab should include a list of people collaborating on the experiment.  The three categories that you have to choose from are:**
	1) *‘Mail-in’* ->  A User who will be shipping their samples and buffers to BioCAT.  The experiment will be conducted by one of our Scientific Staff.  No one from your group will be attending the beamtime experiment in-person.
	2) *‘Off-site/ Co-proposer’* ->  A User who is a collaborator, but this person has not been involved in the communications between their group and the BioCAT Scientific Liaison.  
	3) *‘On-site’* ->  A User who plans on being at BioCAT for the duration of their experiment to actively participate in the preparation and data-collection process.

*   If you intend on bringing any non-US Citizen to the APS, you must begin
    the User application process 6 weeks in advance to make a time allowance for the
    Security Background Checks/Approvals needed, if they are not currently an active
    User at the APS.

*Please choose a Spokesperson (SP) for this experiment.  This will be the User who has prepared the ESAF and can personally verify that all information contained therein is accurate and true.*

-> If you will be a ‘Mail-in’ User (BioCAT does support 'Remote-User Experiments') you must electronically sign the ESAF on the 'Experimenters' Tab to personally verify that the statements and Materials declared in your ESAF are correct -- there will be a link in the top third of the page that says, in red:
<<"An Electronic Signature is required for this ESAF.  A person designated as an "SP" must provide the signature.  Click to provide the Signature.">>

**-> The 'Materials' Tab should contain a complete list of the buffers, chemicals, and samples which you intend on bringing or shipping to BioCAT.**
Concerning the transport of chemicals – all chemicals must be transported or shipped according to the Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulations.  This is best achieved by consulting with the shipping department of your home institution so that they may ship the chemicals according to the hazards that they present.  Alternatively, chemicals needed in larger quantities which have an associated hazard may be purchased and shipped directly to BioCAT for your use while conducting the experiment.

*You must list expression systems or sources for your proteins in the Materials section after the protein/ sample name*


*   On the *'Materials Tab'* near the bottom-half of the web-page there is the question
    'Will you require to use beamline laboratory facilities to prepare samples or
    perform other work?' click 'Yes" if you intend on using our Wet-Lab to prepare
    your samples.  A *'Lab Use'* tab will then be generated, which should be filled out.

**->If you plan on bringing any electronics to be used in your experiment (other than personal computers) please check the 'Electrical Equipment' Box and the 'Bringing to APS' box in the 'EQUIPMENT' Tab to schedule an electrical inspection.**

*   You must declare any electrical equipment that you will be bringing to the
    APS as part of the proposed experiment. On the *‘Equipment Tab’* of the ESAF
    click *‘Bringing to APS’* and Electrical if this applies to you and then
    choose any Tab at the top of the page to force the *'Electrical Inspection'*
    tab to appear.  If you are bringing modified NRTL or non-NRTL equipment or
    unsure NRTL check the appropriate boxes and fill in the *'List equipment
    that will require an inspection'*.

**   Please verify the completeness of your data before hitting the *'Submit'* Button.**
