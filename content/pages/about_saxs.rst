.. lead::   Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) is a widely used technique for the
            measurement of the radius of gyration (Rg) and the electron pair distance
            distribution function (P(r)), as well as for ab initio modeling of
            low-resolution molecular envelopes of macromolecules in solution.


Standard SAXS
==============

The BioCAT standard experimental set-up includes a Pilatus 1M detector from
Dectris (Switzerland) and a camera of 3.5 m sample-to-detector distance to
access a range of momentum transfer, q, from ~0.04 to 3.3 nm-1. This range
of q allows not only accurate determination of radius of gyration, but also
detailed modeling using ab initio and rigid body approaches.

For static or equilibrium SAXS, a quartz capillary flow cell which is
temperature controlled through a water bath can be used. It takes usually
about 50-100 microliter of sample. However, in some cases smaller volume
(< 20 microliter) can also yield usable SAXS data. In order to reduce
radiation damage, the sample flows through the X-ray beam using a Hamilton
programmable dual-syringe pump.

We also offer SAXS data collection coupled with online Size Exclusion
Chromatography (SEC). The sample runs through a size exclusion column to
separate potential aggregates or different oligomeric states intermediately
before flowing through the capillary for X-ray exposure.

The high flux and efficient detectors at BioCAT allow collection of scattering
patterns and permits time-resolved experiments on the ms time scale using
the stopped-flow apparatus. We are also developing advanced microfluidic
mixers, including the chaotic mixer and laminar flow mixer, to collect SAXS
data on the tens of ms and sub-ms time regime. Friendly users are welcome to
submit proposals to conduct pilot time-resolved SAXS experiments on their systems.


Time-Resolved SAXS
====================

The utility of SAXS in no more limited to the structural characterization
of biological macromolecules in equilibrium. We are actively developing
technologies to investigate the dynamic behavior of the macromolecules using
SAXS during processes such as protein and RNA folding, and enzyme-substrate/co-factor
binding. Studying structural changes in time regimes ranging from ~50µs to
seconds requires the use of a variety of mixers that can interface with the
SAXS instrument. Stopped flow mixers have been used by several groups and
have shown dead-times less than 1ms (Jacob, Krantz et al. 2004, Roh, Guo
et al. 2010). However, continuous flow mixers have emerged as the best option
for SAXS in sub-millisecond time-scales.

Rapid mixing devices for SAXS have fallen into two broad categories --
turbulent and laminar (Pollack and Doniach 2009, Kathuria, Guo et al. 2011,
Kathuria, Chan et al. 2013). These devices facilitate rapid and efficient
mixing events between multiple fluid streams containing the biological
macromolecule of interest and small solutes that engender structural
changes in the macromolecule. Laminar mixing utilizes hydrodynamic focusing
to reduce the central flow channel to a narrow (typically ~0.1-10 µm)
sheath. A version of this mixer is currently under development at BioCAT
(See Figure). For turbulent mixing, turbulent flow that breaks the solution
into eddies small enough for reactants to diffuse rapidly. Turbulent flow
mixers have the advantage of being able to use all of the delivered photon
flux in the X-ray beam for the best signal to noise ratio. The plug flow
in this kind of mixer also makes the reaction time uniform orthogonally
to the flow-direction thus making its incorporation into a SAXS camera
quite straight forward. The progress we have made in terms of time
resolution and sample consumption are well documented (Wu, Kondrashkina
et al. 2008, Graceffa, Nobrega et al. 2014, Kathuria, Kayatekin et al.
2014, and Nobrega, Arora et al. 2014). In its' current iteration, we can
access time regimes as low as 50µs and a complete experiment can be
performed with as little as 10mgs of sample.
