BioCAT regards safety to be of central importance. No experiment or operation
will be permitted at the facility if it poses a significant safety risk.
BioCAT's general safety policies are detailed in our `Environment, Safety, and
Health Plan <http://pinky.bio.aps.anl.gov/staffwiki/BioCATESHPlan>`_. For
specific experiments, the APS safety review process has been instituted to
minimize the exposure to hazards.
