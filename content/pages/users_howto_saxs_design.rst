:title: How to design an equilibrium SAXS experiment

:slug: how-to-design-saxs-exp


SAXS has emerged as a standard biophysical tool deployed routinely for
characterizing macromolecules of biomedical interest. The relative logistical
simplicity embodied in a technique that provides easy access to the size and
low-resolution shape of macromolecules makes it an essential part of the
biophysicists' tool kit. With the introduction of Size-Exclusion Chromatography
(SEC)-SAXS at BioCAT, which ensures monodispersity of even the most biochemically c
hallenging molecules, structural parameters such as the Radius of Gyration (Rg),
Maximum Dimension (Dmax), Volume and Molecular weight estimates can be determined
with a high degree of success for a large variety of samples.

There are three equilibrium data acquisition strategies available at BioCAT:
SEC-SAXS, SEC-MALS-DLS-SAXS, and batch-mode SAXS.

SEC-SAXS
=========

The most common approach uses an AKTA-pure (GE Healthsciences) chromatography
system equipped with a 5 loop-valve and a 5 column-valve that is also capable of
automation. We also provide most generally used gel-filtration columns from GE
healthsciences, namely superdex-200 increase, superdex-75 and superose-6
(both the 10/300 and 5/150 sizes), which can resolve proteins in sizes ranging
from 3 kDa to 5 MDa from potential aggregates and other contaminants such as
break down products.

SEC-MALS-DLS-SAXS
==================

Also available is an Agilent Infinity II HPLC system which, in addition to the
multi-wavelength UV detector, is combined with the HELEOS II (Wyatt Inc.)
multi-angle light scattering (MALS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and a tREX
differential refractive index (dRI) detectors, which supplement the size and
shape information from SAXS with reliable molecular weight estimates, hydrodynamic
radius (Rh), and concentration. This method elegantly combines several biophysical
tools along with the distinct advantage of minimizing sample consumption. We
have a wide array of HPLC SEC columns from Wyatt manufactured specifically to
suit the stringent requirements of the MALS and DLS detectors. The Agilent
Infinity II also has an inbuilt auto-sampler which can load up to 166 samples
without user intervention. Sample quality pre-requisites for this system are
considerably more stringent than the simpler SEC-SAXS setup in approach 1 and
the suitability of your sample must be determined through discussion with beamline
personnel.

Batch-mode
============

For rare cases where sample concentration and volume are inadequate for SEC-SAXS,
we are able to directly load the sample onto the SAXS flow cell (common for all
three approaches) using a Hamilton syringe pump equipped with a multiway valve.
We typically collect data while maintaining unidirectional flow of the sample
through the capillary thus avoiding radiation damage. We also have an auto-sampler
which can be deployed for large numbers of samples (in 96 well format) that need
to be screened efficiently.
