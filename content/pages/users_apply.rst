:slug: applying-for-time

BioCAT is an NIH-supported Biotechnology Research Resource. Anyone can
use the facility for free by putting in an application through the
APS GUP program. These applications are reviewed on the basis of
feasibility and scientific merit. Obtaining time at the BioCAT facility is a
multiple-step process. Below is a listing of the eleven things you need to
do---from start to finish---to acquire, use, and complete time at BioCAT.
Please also check the `APS new user checklist <http://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/Getting-Started/User-Checklist>`_.

#.  `Discuss Your Proposed Experiment with Us <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_

    Our facility is very flexible and can accommodate most experiments that
    fall within our `supported techniques <{filename}/pages/about_biocat.rst>`_.
    We strongly encourage you to discuss your experiment with the `user liaison <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_
    for your technique. This will save a lot of time assembling and
    debugging your set-up giving you more time to acquire high-quality data
    once you've arrived.

#.  `Register as an APS Experimenter ("User") <https://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/ufr_main_pkg.usr_start_page>`_

    The Advanced Photon Source resides within Argonne National Laboratory which is a
    controlled-access facility. This step initiates the process for granting access to
    ANL, as well as, the process for ensuring that `safety and compliance
    <{filename}/pages/users_safety.rst>`_ requirements are met.

#.  `Submit a Proposal <http://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/About-Proposals/Apply-for-Time>`_

    The primary mechanism for access to BioCAT is through the APS General User Program. Further
    information on classes of experiments, allocation of time by category, and the proposal
    review process is available `from the APS <http://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/About-Proposals/Apply-for-Time>`_.

    Users with active proposals wishing time in the next run should complete follow
    the directions for a Returning Proposer on the `APS website <http://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/About-Proposals/Apply-for-Time>`_.

#.  `Complete the Experiment Safety Assessment Form (ESAF) <http://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/esaf0001.start_page>`_

    Every proposal awarded beam time must be accompanied by an approved Experiment Safety Assessment
    Form (ESAF) before it is allowed to proceed.

    For an ESAF to be valid, it must list all experimenters to be present at the facility. In
    addition, when listing materials, protein names must be written out in full (i.e. no
    abbreviations with the exception of "DNA" and "RNA")

    If your experiment does not involve any of the hazards listed below, submitting the ESAF
    **two weeks** before your scheduled beam time should provide enough time for its review and
    possible revision. Please visit our Safety & Compliance page for further instructions.

    Please submit your ESAF far enough in advance to resolve any safety issues so that your experiment
    can proceed.

    N.B.: Hazards Requiring Additional Review

    There are a number of hazards which will require a more detailed (and, therefore, prolonged) review
    before access can be granted:

    *   `Bio-Hazardous Materials <http://www.anl.gov/safety/biosafety>`_

        Experiments utilizing any of the following items will have to be coordinated far
        in advance with your Scientific Contact, Mark Vukonich (BioCAT BSO), and Nena Moonier
        (APS BSO) to be reviewed formally by the ANL Institutional Biosafety Committee(IBC)
        as well as the IIT IBC:

        *   Human tissues or fluids
        *   Animal tissues derived from diseased animals
        *   Some plants and plant pathogens
        *   Some viruses and bacteria
        *   Some proteins which may be involved in causing disease or harmful effects of
            the disease process
        *   Some sequences of DNA or RNA

        The IBCs oversee the safety of all experimental participants and ratify the proposed
        experimental protocol according to Centers for Disease Control, Department of Transportation,
        and Department of Agriculture regulations. This is a process which can take upwards of
        three months; so consult with your Scientific Contact for IBC application instructions
        well in advance if you think your experiment might require the approval of the IBC.

    *   `Lasers <{filename}/pages/users_lasers.rst>`_

        Use of any other than a class I laser requires additional ANL-supplied training. You
        will need to schedule a few hours to complete this training. In addition, use of a
        class IIIb or IV laser will require a written Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and
        an on-site review of the assembled (but not aligned) laser system before work may
        begin. A class IV laser will require all operators to have an ANL-approved off-site
        eye examination.

    *   `Electrical Equipment <http://www.aps.anl.gov/Safety-and-Training/Safety/Electrical-Safety>`_

        All electrical equipment which is not certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing
        Laboratory (NRTL) (such as Underwriters Laboratories) or is modified will need to be
        inspected before it may be used at the APS. A listing of approved NRTLs is
        `provided here <https://www.osha.gov/dts/otpca/nrtl/>`_.

#.  `Arrange for Shipping <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_

    Please be aware that the transportation of many materials is regulated by the US
    Department of Transportation as well as ANL. Failure to comply with DOT regulations
    can result in heavy fines. Failure to comply with ANL regulations can result in loss
    of access to the facility.

#.  Establish a "User Account"

    BioCAT requests that all experimenters submit a purchase order to ANL in care of the
    APS "User Account Specialist" to provide a mechanism for covering costs that may be
    incurred at the APS on their behalf. Such costs include: shipping, purchases from the
    APS stock room, supplies ordered through the Argonne Materials Ordering System (AMOS),
    and fabrication of items at an APS/ANL shop.

#.  Complete Training and Orientation

    Once you arrive, both the `APS <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Safety-and-Training/Training/For-Users-and-Employees/Required-Training-for-Users>`_
    and `BioCAT <{filename}/pages/users_safety.rst>`_ will require certain
    training and orientation sessions to be taken before you may proceed with
    your experiment. These sessions will be determined by the ESAF process.
    Some of these are available on-line. Please visit `Safety and
    Compliance <{filename}/pages/users_safety.rst>`_ for further details.

#.  Observe Beamline Etiquette

    Please, while you're here:

    *   Be courteous to your host staff.

        We work hard supporting back-to-back experiments that run 24 hours a day for multiple
        days during the three-month-long "run". We will do all that is humanly possible to
        support your experiment while you're here, but we will also show you basic trouble-shooting
        algorithms that will help you diagnose some problems on your own---saving you time.

    *   Be patient.

        Your experiment block includes time required for set-up. For non-standard
        experiments,unless otherwise arranged, you should expect at least one shift
        to be used aligning optics and assembling sample holders before your experiment
        is ready to begin the debugging phase.

    *   Keep your work areas as orderly and free of debris as possible.
    *   `Collect Your Data <{filename}/pages/users_computing.rst>`_

        It is now becoming more and more common for experiments to generate tens of GB
        of data. Please be prepared to collect this data so that you can transmit it to your
        home institution. We recommend a USB 3 1 TB external hard-drive. BioCAT
        is not supported to supply experimenters with storage media.

    *   Relinquish the facilities at the appointed time.

        Typically, the experimenter following you begins at 0800 on your last day. Unless
        otherwise arranged, you should have your equipment already dismantled and the hutch
        and bio-chem lab cleared by this time.

#.  Complete an End of Experiment Form

    Once your experiment is over, we request that you provide BioCAT and
    `the APS <http://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/eef002.start_page>`_ with any comments
    and constructive criticisms so that your next experiment can run more efficiently.

#.  Publish Your Results

    When you publish your results, be sure to
    `properly acknowledge the APS and BioCAT <{filename}/pages/users_publications.rst>`_,
    and notify both the APS and BioCAT of such publications. Peer-reviewed publications
    are are the primary measure of scientific output. Properly documented publications insure
    that funds are available to continue operating the facility.

#.  Refine Your Experiment

    Most of our experimenters return for subsequent experiments. Keep in
    touch with your  `user liaison <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ and
    follow through on proposed modifications to your experiment. It is very
    important that ideas for improving your experiment are not lost between visits.
