Overview
============

BioCAT is an NIH-supported Biotechnology Research Resource. Anyone can
use the facility for free by putting in an application through the
APS GUP program. These applications are reviewed on the basis of
feasibility and scientific merit. Obtaining time at the BioCAT facility is a
multiple-step process. Below is a listing of the things you need to
do - from start to finish - to acquire, use, and complete time at BioCAT.
Please also check the `APS new user checklist
<https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/Getting-Started/User-Checklist/APS>`_.

#.  `Discuss Your Proposed Experiment with Us <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_

    Our facility is very flexible and can accommodate most experiments that
    fall within our `supported techniques <{filename}/pages/about_biocat.rst>`_.
    We strongly encourage you to discuss your experiment with the `user liaison <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_
    for your technique. This will save a lot of time assembling and
    debugging your set-up giving you more time to acquire high-quality data
    once you've arrived.

#.  `Register as an APS Experimenter ("User") <https://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/ufr_main_pkg.usr_start_page>`_

    The Advanced Photon Source resides within Argonne National Laboratory which is a
    controlled-access facility. This step initiates the process for granting access to
    ANL, as well as the process for ensuring that `safety and compliance
    <{filename}/pages/users_safety.rst>`_ requirements are met.

    Everyone participating in the experiment (mailing samples or coming on site)
    must be a registered user. `New users should register and existing users
    should check to make sure their site access is still valid. <https://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/ufr_main_pkg.usr_start_page>`_
    **It can take the APS several weeks to process your user registration,
    both for new users and for updates to current users' site access, so make
    sure everyone in your group does this as soon as you know you want beamtime.**

#.  `Submit a Proposal <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/About-Proposals/Apply-for-Time>`_

    The primary mechanism for access to BioCAT is through the APS General User Program. Further
    information on classes of experiments, allocation of time by category, and the proposal
    review process is available `from the APS <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/About-Proposals/Apply-for-Time>`_.

    If you are apply for beamtime within the current run, or for the next run after
    the standard GUP proposal deadline has passed, you will need to put in a Rapid
    Access proposal. To do so, when creating a new proposal select the "General
    Users" proposal and then select the "General User - Rapid Access" for your
    General User (GU) Proposal Type. These proposals are good for only one run.

    Users with active proposals wishing time in the next run should submit an
    experiment time request by following the directions for a Returning Proposer on
    the `APS website <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/About-Proposals/Apply-for-Time>`_.
    Users with an active proposal who want time in the current run, or for the next
    run after the standard GUP proposal deadline has passed can put in a rapid
    access experiment time request.

    For all proposals to BioCAT you must list the BioCAT beamline, "18-ID-D", as one of
    the beamlines in the "Choice of Beamline" section in the Experiment Time Request.
    For a Rapid Access proposal, you should list only BioCAT in this section.

#.  `Complete the Experiment Safety Assessment Form (ESAF) <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/Safety-Training/Experiment-Safety-Overview>`_

    Every proposal awarded beam time must be accompanied by an approved Experiment Safety Assessment
    Form (ESAF) before it is allowed to proceed.

    **An ESAF for an on-site experiment must be submitted at least 14 days before
    the experiment or it will not be approved. An ESAF for a remote/mail-in experiment
    must be submitted at least 7 days before the experiment
    or it will not be approved.** We recommend submission before these hard deadlines
    so any issues can be resolved and your experiment can proceed as planned.
    Please visit our `ESAF <{filename}/pages/users_esaf.rst>`_
    and `safety and compliance <{filename}/pages/users_safety.rst>`_ pages for more
    information.

    For an ESAF to be valid, it must list all experimenters to be present at the facility
    or mailing in samples. ESAFS will not be approved if listed experimenters do not
    have valid site access, so you must register as a user/renew your site access
    as above. In addition, when listing materials, samples names must
    be written out in full and (when appropriate) the expression system must be included.
    You should not use abbreviations with the exception of "DNA" and "RNA",
    and sample names should be written as, e.g., "Lysozyme from Chicken Egg White"
    rather than "Sample 1".

    If your ESAF involves any of the additional hazards listed below
    it will require a more detailed (and, therefore, prolonged) review
    before access can be granted, so you should submit it at least 1 month before
    your experiment:

    *   `Bio-Hazardous Materials <https://www.anl.gov/safety/biosafety>`_

        Experiments utilizing any of the following items will have to be coordinated far
        in advance with your Scientific Contact, Mark Vukonich (BioCAT BSO), and Nena Moonier
        (APS BSO) to be reviewed formally by the ANL Institutional Biosafety Committee(IBC)
        as well as the IIT IBC:

        *   Human tissues or fluids
        *   Animal tissues derived from diseased animals
        *   Some plants and plant pathogens
        *   Some viruses and bacteria
        *   Some proteins which may be involved in causing disease or harmful effects of
            the disease process
        *   Some sequences of DNA or RNA

        The IBCs oversee the safety of all experimental participants and ratify the proposed
        experimental protocol according to Centers for Disease Control, Department of Transportation,
        and Department of Agriculture regulations. This is a process which can take upwards of
        three months; so consult with your Scientific Contact for IBC application instructions
        well in advance if you think your experiment might require the approval of the IBC.

    *   `Lasers <{filename}/pages/users_lasers.rst>`_

        Use of any other than a class I laser requires additional ANL-supplied training. You
        will need to schedule a few hours to complete this training. In addition, use of a
        class IIIb or IV laser will require a written Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and
        an on-site review of the assembled (but not aligned) laser system before work may
        begin. A class IV laser will require all operators to have an ANL-approved off-site
        eye examination.

    *   `Electrical Equipment <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Safety-and-Training/Safety/Electrical-Safety>`_

        All electrical equipment which is not certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing
        Laboratory (NRTL) (such as Underwriters Laboratories) or is modified will need to be
        inspected before it may be used at the APS. A listing of approved NRTLs is
        `provided here <https://www.osha.gov/dts/otpca/nrtl/>`_.

#.  `Arrange for Shipping <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_

    The preferred method of shipping at Argonne is FedEx Priority Overnight. If you
    want your samples to arrive promptly (the morning after shipping), you must
    use this method. Otherwise they may arrive in the afternoon, or even later.
    Our `shipping page <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_ has more details
    and our shipping address. Note that BioCAT cannot receive packages
    on weekends or holidays.

    Please be aware that the transportation of many materials is regulated by the US
    Department of Transportation as well as ANL. Failure to comply with DOT regulations
    can result in heavy fines. Failure to comply with ANL regulations can result in loss
    of access to the facility.

#.  Establish a "User Account" - BSL2 experiments only

    BioCAT requests that all experimenters doing BSL2 experiments submit a
    purchase order to ANL in care of the APS "User Account Specialist" to
    provide a mechanism for covering costs that may be incurred at the APS on
    their behalf. Such costs include: shipping, purchases from the APS stock
    room, supplies ordered through the Argonne Materials Ordering System (AMOS),
    and fabrication of items at an APS/ANL shop.

#.  Complete Training and Orientation

    Once you arrive, both the `APS <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Safety-and-Training/Training/For-Users-and-Employees/Required-Training-for-Users>`_
    and `BioCAT <{filename}/pages/users_safety.rst>`_ will require certain
    training and orientation sessions to be taken before you may proceed with
    your experiment. These sessions will be determined by the ESAF process.
    Some of these are available on-line. Please visit `Safety and
    Compliance <{filename}/pages/users_safety.rst>`_ for further details.

#.  Arrive at the Beamline

    Argonne National Lab is a closed campus. In order to `obtain site access
    <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/Getting-Started/User-Checklist/APS#siteaccess>`_
    you must first register (step 2, above). **Any on-site user arriving outside of normal business hours on a weekday or on a
    holiday or weekend must request a Gate Pass in advance of their arrival or they will not
    be allowed on site.**

    For on-site users, please note that in order to get your user photo badge or
    gate pass, you will have to show a valid form of photo identification. If you want
    to use a driver's license or other state identification card as your photo ID
    it must be REAL-ID compatible. The Argonne website has
    `more information on how to obtain site access. <https://www.anl.gov/site-entry-requirements>`_

    On-site users must also request a dosimeter at least 3 business days
    in advance of your visit. If you do not do this you will not be allowed on
    the experimental floor. Dosimiters can be picked up in the 401 building by
    the APS user office. The APS website has `more information on how to request
    a dosimeter. <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/APS-Dosimetry-Information>`_
    **You are not allowed on the experimental floor without your dosimeter, so be
    sure to pick it up when you first arrive at the APS.**

    Nominally your beamtime starts at 8 am on your first scheduled day. In practice,
    you should usually plan to arrive at the beamline between 9:30-10 am unless
    otherwise specified by your scientific contact. If you have
    particular questions or concerns about the start of your beamtime, contact
    your scientific contact. **You cannot start any work until you ESAF is posted,
    so if you arrive before your scientific contact wait in the LOM until they
    arrive. Do not start working on your own!**

#.  Observe Beamline Etiquette

    Please, while you're here:

    *   Be courteous to your host staff.

        We work hard supporting back-to-back experiments that run 24 hours a day for multiple
        days during the three-month-long "run". We will do everything we can to
        support your experiment while you're here, but we will also show you basic trouble-shooting
        algorithms that will help you diagnose some problems on your own---saving you time.

    *   Be patient.

        Your experiment block includes time required for set-up and training. For non-standard
        experiments, unless otherwise arranged, you should expect at least one shift
        to be used for basic setup before we're ready to begin the debugging phase.

    *   Keep your work areas as orderly and free of debris as possible.

    *   Relinquish the facilities at the appointed time.

        Typically, the experimenter following you begins at 0800 on your last day. Unless
        otherwise arranged, you should have your equipment already dismantled and the hutch
        and bio-chem lab cleared by this time.

#.  `Collect your data <{filename}/pages/users_computing.rst>`_

    It is now common for experiments to generate tens of GB (or more)
    of data. Please be prepared to collect this data so that you can transmit it to your
    home institution.

    For on-site users we recommend a USB 3 external hard-drive with (a minimum of)
    1 TB of space. BioCAT does not supply experimenters with storage media.

    For mail-in users (and upon request for on-site users) BioCAT will upload
    your data to Globus and provide instructions for downloading your data from there.

#.  Complete an End of Experiment Form

    Once your experiment is over, we request that you provide `BioCAT and
    the APS <https://beam.aps.anl.gov/pls/apsweb/eef002.start_page>`_ with any comments
    and constructive criticisms so that your next experiment can run more efficiently.

#.  Refine Your Experiment

    Most of our experimenters return for subsequent experiments. Keep in
    touch with your `scientific contact <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_ and
    follow through on proposed modifications to your experiment. It is very
    important that ideas for improving your experiment are not lost between visits.

#.  Publish Your Results

    When you publish your results, be sure to
    `properly acknowledge the APS and BioCAT <{filename}/pages/users_publications.rst>`_,
    and notify both the APS and BioCAT of such publications. Peer-reviewed publications
    are are the primary measure of scientific output. Properly documented publications insure
    that funds are available to continue operating the facility.
