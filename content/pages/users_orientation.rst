The Tour of the Facilities
===========================

*   The Lab/Office Modules

    *   Pentagon ''C''

        *   Bathrooms/Tornado Shelters

            *   The bathrooms are located on either side of the ''C'' pentagon.
                They are two of three tornado shelters.

            *   Tornado alerts

                *   Tornado Watch

                    A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable for the
                    production of funnel clouds (typically during a spring-time,
                    super-cell thunderstorm here in the Chicago area).

                *   Tornado Warning

                    A tornado warning means that a funnel cloud has been
                    spotted in the local area. A wailing siren will sound and
                    people should re-locate to a designated tornado shelter---
                    the two bathrooms and the user shop (if open). The beam will
                    be dumped in the event of a tornado warning.

        *   Kitchenette

            *   Recycle Bins
            *   Boiling Water Tap

        *   Dosimeter Storage

            As of 2003 January 1, off-site users are not required to wear
            radiation monitors while on the experiment floor.

            However, a TLD should be issued if any of the following criteria
            are met:

            *   If you are to work in a posted Controlled Area.
            *   If you are to work in the accelerator tunnel; buildings 411,
                412, 413, or 420; the Storage Ring Utility Corridor; or the Storage
                Ring Mezzanine.
            *   If you are to work with radioactive material samples, sealed
                sources, or x-ray generators.
            *   If you intend to work on the experiment floor for more than four
                months per year.
            *   If you are pregnant.
            *   If you request one.

            You may request a TLD from the APS User Office, any Floor Coordinator,
            or From our Administrative Assistant, Carrie Clark.

        *   LOM Access

            Access to the LOM from outside the APS is restricted outside the
            hours of 0700-1900 Monday through Friday. To access the building
            ''after hours'' you should have a key-card issued by the User Office.

        *   "Wandering"

            The research going on at the APS is, for the most part, open.
            However, it is important to respect the privacy of other researchers---
            especially those engaging in proprietary research.

            Both sectors on either side of BioCAT---IMCA-CAT and SBC-CAT---
            perform proprietary research on a regular basis---as do a number
            of other sectors around the ring. Before entering any other beam-line's
            LOM, labs, or experimental hutches, you must obtain the permission of
            the CAT staff first. Failure to do this could result in being barred
            from BioCAT or---if evidence of tampering with equipment or data is
            found---from the APS.

    *   Pentagon ''B''--- BioCAT

Safety Policies and Resources
===============================

Affirmation and Clarification of the "Safety First" Principle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We at BioCAT affirm that we regard the safety of the experimenter and others at
the APS to be of central importance. No experiment or operation will be permitted
on the floor if it poses a significant safety risk. The APS/CAT safety review
process has been instituted to minimize the likelyhood of anyone associated with
our beam line being exposed to hazards.

Orientation to the CAT's Environmental, Safety, and Health Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BioCAT's environmental, safety, and health information is contained in our
Environmental, Safety, and Health Plan. This document has been accepted as
authoritiative by the appropriate committee at the APS and is the definitive
safety document regulating BioCAT operations. Copies of our ES&H Plan are
available in three locations:

#.  On the World Wide Web at http://www.bio.aps.anl.gov/training/BioCAT-SafetyPlan2004.html
#.  In the control ''area'' on the experimental floor
#.  In the Conference Room next to the MSDSs

Explanation of the CAT's General Policies Pertaining to Control of Hazards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BioCAT's three fundamental policies are:

*   Each individual working in the BioCAT facilities is responsible for maintaining
    a safe work environment for themselves and those nearby.
*   The BioCAT staff will ensure that no one will be inside a closed radiation enclosure.
*   Each person working in the BioCAT facilities will be aware of the procedures
    required for maintaining a safe environment and will know who is responsible
    for specific aspects of safety maintenance and enforcement.

Explanation of the ANL-East "Stop Work Authority" Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ''...[I]f you see any work being conducted that you believe may put you or
    others in immediate danger, you have the right and the obligation to stop
    the work and bring the situation to the immediate attention of [BioCAT] and
    a floor coordinator. If you are asked to stop work, you must do so.'' (APS
    User Orientation section 2.0)

General Safety Information
===========================

Location of Safety Equipment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First Aid Kit: The first aid kit is located in the 435B Conference room in the
center bookshelf. Please alert a BioCAT staff member if you use any of the
supplies in the Kit so that they may be replenished.

Fire Extinguishers: There are fire extinguishers in the experiment hall on
every third column around the ring---including columns 115 and 118 near the BioCAT
beamlines.

There are also fire extinguishers in the main hallway of the LOM. They are on
both sides of each pentagon.

Once you have used a fire extinguisher, please call 911 and inform them so the extinguisher may be replaced.

Emergency Shower and Eye-wash: The shower and eyewash are located in the
BioCAT chemistry lab (435-B030) on the ring-side wall.

Location of Safety Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   The BioCAT ES&H Plan may be found in the three places mentioned above.
*   The Argonne ES&H Manual may be found on the web at
    http://www.aim.anl.gov/manuals/eshman/index.html
*   MSDS for all chemicals that BioCAT stores are maintained in a binder just
    outside the west door of the chemistry lab (435-B030).
*   A more comprehensive list of MSDSs may be found in the Conference Room.

Emergency Phone Numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**DIAL 911 FIRST**

(630) 252 1911 from an off-site phone

After speaking with the 911 operator, contact the Safety Officer and Floor
Coordinator. These numbers are posted throughout BioCAT:

*   On the main bulletin board
*   In the cubicles
*   On yellow safety boards immediately outside each lab near the entrance to the beam line
*   On the yellow safety boards on the outside of the doors to the ''C'' and ''D'' hutches.
*   On the upper-left panel of the control console.

Please familiarlize yourself with these locations.

Response to Alarms and Other Warnings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   Fire:

    *   Signal: A steady alarm-clock bell
    *   Action: Evacuate building. Assemble in front of pentagon ''C'' if the
        alarm is sounding in the LOM. Wait for further instructions from the
        person wearing the orange Area Emergency Supervisor (AES) hat.

    (APS User Guide section 1.3)

*   Tornado:

    *   Signal: Public Address announcement [inside] and wailing siren [outside]
    *   Action: Move to tornado shelter. There are three shelters in the BioCAT area:

        *   The two bathrooms on either side of pentagon ''C''
        *   The machine shop

    (APS User Guide section 1.2)

*   Miscellaneous Alarms:

    *   Signal: Twenty (20) second tone over Public Address system.
    *   Action: Listen for information following tone.

Location and Requirements for Use of Safety Eye-wear and other Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**PLEASE RETURN ALL PPE TO ITS ORIGINAL LOCATION WHEN DONE**

*   Eye-wear: Safety eye-wear in the form of safety glasses or goggles should be
    worn at all times in the LOM shop and, when work requirements dictate, in
    the chemistry and electronics laboratories.

    *   Chemistry Lab: Eye-wear may be found on the wall to the right of the
        south entrance and in the first drawer to the right of the south entrance.
    *   Electronics Lab: Eye-wear may be found on the wall to the right of the
        south entrance and on the bench below it.
    *   LOM Shop: On the inside of the right-hand door.

*   Chemical Gloves

    *   Wear gloves and an apron when working with materials that are hazardous
        to your skin, such as corrosive liquids and organic solvents.
    *   Location: In the chemistry lab in the drawer next to the eyewear

*   Work Gloves

    *   Location: In the cage on the right side of cabinet #6

*   Safety Harnesses

    *   If you are working 6 feet (2 meters) or more above floor level at a
        location where there are no guard rails or other installed fall protection,
        you must use a fall-arrest system (e.g., a body harness and secured lanyard).

    *   Location: In the cage on the right side of cabinet #6.

*   Hard Hats

    *   Hard hats are required whenever any crane or scissor lift is being
        operated in your area. Other areas will be posted with the requirement.

    *   Location: In the cage on the right side of cabinet #6.

Restrictions on Working Alone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following has been taken from the APS User Safety Guide:

"When activities at the APS involve substantial hazards, working alone is not
permitted; that is, you must remain in visual and auditory contact with a second
person who understands the work being performed and all pertinent emergency
procedures. The following are examples of materials or systems that are considered
to pose substantial hazards:

*   high-energy or high-pressure systems.
*   acutely toxic or corrosive gases, liquids, or solids.
*   cryogenic materials in greater than bench-scale amounts.
*   flammable liquids or chemicals in greater than bench-scale amounts.
*   x-ray generators, if you are not an authorized user of the device in question.
*   electrical systems capable of producing a paralyzing shock when proper safeguards are not in place.''

In additon, when working in the LOM shop after hours, you must notify the APS floor coordinator.

The Importance of Keeping Work Areas Neat and Orderly, and the Aisles Free of Obstructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please remember that you are utilizing shared space for your experiment. Many
people who are not necessarily familliar with your equipment will be in the same
area and may need the same facilities. Keeping a minimal, organized workspace
is essential to providing all our users with the facilities they need to perform
their experiments in an accurate and timely manner.

It is essential that aisles, walkways, and all officially demarcated access
corridors and duck-unders (lined with yellow tape) are kept free of equipment
as these are escape routes in the event of an emergency.

Storage of Chemicals and Gas Cylinders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chemicals: Please store your chemicals in the designated cabinets in the chemistry
lab. Users are strongly discouraged from bringing in bulk chemicals. If you must
bring in bulk chemicals, you must contact the BioCAT Safety Coordinator in order
to clear the required paperwork prior to its arrival on-site.

Gas Cylinders: Charged gas cylinders should be available for your use inside
hutch-D. Should you need another gas cylinder, they are stored in two places:

*   Around the outside of hutch ''D'' (either in the cage or on the wall
    closest to the storage ring).
*   In the cage labeled "Sector 18" in the yard on the other side of the sector
    20 truck lock (just down stream of 435E).

Please use the gas cylinder dolly---located in the cage---for transporting gas
cylinders; and please return it when done.

Please observe the following safety precautions when using gas cylinders:

*   Gas cylinders should be transported with their caps screwed on.
*   No gas cylinder should ever be left unattended when not properly secured to
    a designated gas cylinder rack

Proper Usage of Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Do not leave the APS complex with your thermo-luminescent dosimeter (TLD).*

Between the two bathrooms are TLD storage boxes. Please locate an empty box,
label it with your name, and place your TLD there whenever you leave the building.

*These dosimeters are only valid until the end of the calendar month.*

When you leave the APS for an extended period, please return your TLD to the
person who gave it to you (if from Clareen, then return it to Clareen; if from
the Floor Coordinator, then return it to the Floor Coordinator). Only place your
TLD in the Dosimeter Return bins if you received your TLD from the APS user office.

Proper Usage of Radioactive Check Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BioCAT Safety Plan does not currently address the use of radioactive sources.
Anyone who wishes to perform research at BioCAT utilizing radionucleides must
have prior approval from the BioCAT staff and must adhere to all requirements
specified by BioCAT, the Advanced Photon Source, and Argonne National Laboratories
for their transport and use.

Storage of Other Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sharps: Small, sharp objects can pose a significant hazard to you, other users,
and maintenance staff. Such objects include, but are not limited to: syringe
needles, knife/razor blades, tiny diameter stiff wire, and broken glass. All
sharp objects must be stored in a way that minimizes the risk of laceration and
possible introduction of foriegn objects into the body. Methods may include
insertion of the sharp surface into a sizable piece of cork or styrofoam.

**Sharps are not to be disposed of in the regular trash bin!** Used syringe
needles, razor blades, and scalpels must be disposed of in the sharps disposal
box. Broken glass must be cleaned up immediately with the hand-broom and dustpan
and disposed of in the cardboard box labeled "Broken Glass."

No item may be stored on top of a cabinet exceeding five feet in height.

Restrictions on and Proper Use of Electrical Power Strips and Extension Cords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following has been taken from the APS User Safety Guide:

''Do not use single-to-multiple outlet converters ("cube taps"). If necessary,
use power distribution strips with integral power cords and built-in overcurrent
protection. These strips are available through the Argonne Materials Ordering
System (AMOS).

Suspend electrical cords over the work area if possible, to avoid damaging them
or creating a tripping hazard. If this is not feasible, mark the location as a
work area by using appropriate signs or barricades and place "cord ducts" or
other protective runways over the cords.

Properly identify electrical cables at their ends and at all spliced junctions,
to facilitate eventual cable removal.... Immediately remove all cables that are
no longer in use and update the tables and diagrams accordingly.

Use only CAT-issued or CAT-approved extension cords. To prevent overheating or
possible electrical shock, choose cords rated for current levels that exceed
your needs by a safe margin.

Never run extension cords through walls, windows, or doorways or behind walls,
ceilings, or floors. Never connect extension cords in series or splice them
together.

Procedure for Obtaining and Using Liquid Nitrogen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Liquid nitrogen may be obtained at the fill station in the sector 20 truck lock
(just down stream of 435E) or from our house liquid nitrogen line on the upstream
wall of hutch-C. Users will be responsible for refilling their own dewars once
they have been certified by BioCAT staff. Proper Personal Protective equipment
(PPE) is to be used while handling liquid nitrogen (gloves, face-shield, and apron).

Disposal of Waste, Including Hazardous Waste
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended that white paper, glass containers, and aluminium cans be
disposed of in the appropriately labeled blue canisters in the LOM, the beamline,
and the communal kitchen in pentagon 'C.' Ordinary trash may be disposed of in
any available trash can.

BioCAT assumes that all chemical waste is hazardous. Any procedures which
generate such waste must be reviewed by the Chemical Safety Officer if this
waste is to be disposed of here at the APS.

Beam-line Safety Information
===============================

"Proper attire for work in the experiment hall includes closed-toes, covered-heel
shoes and long pants. Sandals or any type of open-toe shoes are not acceptable.
Skirts may be worn if a lab coat is also worn." (APS User Guide section 2.1)

Orientation to BioCAT's Implementation of the APS Shielding Configuration Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exposure to radiation is an important safety issue at the APS. Shielding has
been placed at a number of points around our beam-line to reduce this risk such
that exposure to radiation levels above natural background is virtually impossible.
To maintain this level of safety, it is important that you not alter any part of
the beam-line shielding. Typically, all critical shielding has been tagged, but,
when in doubt, ask!

If you need to open any of the labyrinths, ask for help from your scientific contact.

Locations of the Utility Shut-Offs for Electricity, Water, and Compressed Gases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Electricity: There are two types of power: "clean" and "dirty." The outlets for
clean power are orange and should only be used for electrical components
sensitive to voltage spikes. No motors or other inductive components are to
be connected to clean power.

Each outlet is labeled with the breaker that supplies it. These first-level
breakers are located in the hutch for outlets in the hutch and on the outside
of the hutch for outlets located outside of the hutch. These breaker boxes are
labeled with the second-level breaker box and circuits that source power to it.

The second-level breaker boxes are located on column 119.

Water: The shut-off for water for hutch-D is located inside hutch ''D'' on the
inboard wall. They are the third and fourth red handles.

Compressed Air: The shut-off for compressed air for hutch-D is located inside
hutch-D on the inboard wall. It is the green handle to the right of the water
shut-off valves.

Explanation of the Use of Radiation Survey Meters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BioCAT Safety Plan does not currently address the use of radiation survey
meters by users. If you need a survey meter, BioCAT staff will arrange to borrow
one from the APS Health Physics department.

Users who have concerns about ambient radiation levels are encouraged to approach
any of the BioCAT safety officers or an APS Floor Coordinator who will perform
a survey.

General and Beam-line-Specific Operation of the Personnel Safety System (PSS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users will recieve training in the use of the 18-ID PSS. This training will
include specific inforomation on

*   Searching a hutch
*   Closing the door
*   Enabling the shutters
*   Disabling the shutters
*   Opening the door
*   Emergency Beam Stops
*   Emergency Door Release

Only one person should work the PSS at a time. Under no circumstances is a
person allowed to work in a closed hutch.
