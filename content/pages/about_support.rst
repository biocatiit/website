The BioCAT facility has a ~550 square foot wet laboratory with sinks, hoods,
analytical and platform balances, water de-ionizer, chromatography refrigerator,
-20 and -80째C freezers, micro-centrifuge, high-speed centrifuge, Nanodrop,
platform rocker, an EON plate reader and an Bio-Rad NGC FPLC. It is possible to
do a complete on-site purification of proteins from cell-pellets. We have
several Zeiss stereomicroscopes and a Nikon inverted microscope with
epi-flourescence capability. The BioCAT instrumentation lab is also ~550
square feet and contains electronic testing equipment, fabrication and
testing areas and a large granite table for assembling optics. We have
access to a well-equipped machine shop at IIT with one machinist. Argonne
Central Shops (with a satellite shop on site at the APS) can handle larger
jobs. The Advanced Photon Source has a well-equipped metrology shop which
we use to characterize mirror and multilayer optics. For animal care we have
access to the Animal Housing Facility in the Engineering Research Building at IIT.


Biochemistry Lab
=================

.. _wetlab:

The Biochemistry Lab is a well-equipped facility for sample preparation work.
We have all of the equipment needed for the on-site purification of proteins.
We ask that any special requirements be discussed with your Scientific Contact
well in advance of the experiment to determine feasibility and time requirements.
As a User, you have a safety obligation to label any tubes or containers that
you use or generate with a descriptive, but brief, label of the contents of
that vessel. Label should include:

*   biological or chemical content
*   concentration
*   date
*   initials


Our freezers and refrigerators are for short-term use only. Please dispose
of/ship back to your home institution any tubes, solutions, or samples that
you generate while at BioCAT. Those items left in our facility will be purged
as part of ongoing maintenance.

If you are seeking use of our Wet-Lab and are not conducting a **current
experiment as a BioCAT User with scheduled beam time and a posted ESAF**, you
must get explicit permission from the Biochemistry Lab Manager, `Mark Vukonich <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_,
before using the BioCAT Wet-Lab. Also, a "Wet-Lab Only" ESAF must be approved
and posted by beamline staff. **No equipment or materials in the BioCAT Wet-Lab
may be removed, "borrowed," or moved from the BioCAT Wet-Lab.** Any unauthorized
personnel who are spotted in our Wet-lab, without an approved ESAF, will be in
violation of serious safety and security policies at the APS and we will
present the matter to the Floor-Coordinators and the heads of Safety and
Security at the APS.

BioCAT provides most of the basic materials and chemicals that one would
require to prepare a sample for a routine setup. However, specialized chemicals,
instrumentation, tools, and filtering apparatus not found on this page should be
supplied by the User. If you wish to ship chemicals or equipment to BioCAT
consult our `shipping page <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_.

It is expected that the user group will furnish their own consumables and will
make arrangements for any hazardous waste generated while at BioCAT.
