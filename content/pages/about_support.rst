The BioCAT facility has a ~550 square foot wet laboratory with sinks, hoods,
analytical and platform balances, water de-ionizer, chromatography refrigerator,
-20 and -80Â°C freezers, micro-centrifuge, high-speed centrifuge ultracentrifuge,
platform rocker, as well as, a Cary 50 UV/VIS spectrophotometer, an EON plate
reader and an AKTA FPLC. It is possible to do a complete on-site purification
of proteins from cell-pellets. We have several Zeiss stereomicroscopes and a
Nikon inverted microscope with epi-flourescence capability. The BioCAT
instrumentation lab is also ~550 square feet and contains electronic testing
equipment, fabrication and testing areas and a large granite table for
assembling optics. We have access to a well-equipped machine shop at IIT
with one machinist. Argonne Central Shops (with a satellite shop on site
at the APS) can handle larger jobs. The Advanced Photon Source has a
well-equippedmetrology shop which we use to characterize mirror and
multilayer optics. For animal care we have access to the Animal Housing
Facility in the Engineering Research Building at IIT.
