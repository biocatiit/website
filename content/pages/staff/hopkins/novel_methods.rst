A good portion of my time is/was spent developing novel methods for doing
SAXS. A brief description is given below.

CryoSAXS
==========

Overview
----------

Biomolecular SAXS signals can rapidly degrade due to radiation damage, so that
flow or oscillating cells and large total sample volumes may be required. For
particularly sensitive or hard to produce samples (such as of light sensitive
proteins, metalloenzymes, and large complexes), and studies where multiple buffer
conditions are probed (such as ligand binding experiments), sample consumption
may be prohibitive.

We explored cryo-cooling of samples to temperatures of 100 K to prevent X-ray
induced biomolecular disruption and aggregation during data collection.
We identify SAXS-friendly cryoprotectant conditions that suppress ice formation
upon cooling, and compare cryoSAXS profiles obtained in window-free variable-path-length
cells with room temperature measurements for a variety of standard molecules.
We obtain data sufficient for envelope reconstructions using scattering volumes as
small as 100 nL, and find good agreement between cryoSAXS data and known atomic
structures. We also developed low-volume fixed path-length sample holders for cryoSAXS.
These enabled reproducible background subtraction without the scaling need by the windowed
sample holders.

Cryo-cooled samples can withstand doses that are 2-3 orders
of magnitude higher than typically used for SAXS at room temperature, comparable
to those used in cryo-crystallography. While practical challenges remain, cryoSAXS
opens the possibility of studies exploiting high brightness X-ray sources and
mail-in high-throughput SAXS.

Time Resolved SAXS
==================

As a postdoc at MacCHESS, I designed, fabricated, and tested microfluidic mixers
for continuous flow time resolved SAXS. That project is still in progress at
MacCHESS, so the results aren't ready to be shared.

As a beamline scientist at BioCAT, I am getting involved in our time resolved
continuous flow project. You can learn more about that on the `main BioCAT
web-page <{filename}/pages/about_saxs.rst>`_
