Overview
==============
As one of three beamline scientists at BioCAT, I dabble in many areas.
Most of my time is spent supporting biological small angle x-ray scattering experiments (SAXS),
and maintaining and improving software and hardware at the beamline. My own
areas of research are novel techniques for biological SAXS, such as
cryoSAXS and TR-SAXS, and radiation damage to biological systems.
