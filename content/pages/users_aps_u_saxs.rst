Overview
=====================================
The BioCAT 18ID beamline will be unavailable from April 17 2023 to summer/fall of
2024 due to the `APS-U dark period <{filename}/pages/users_aps_u.rst>`_. During
that period, users are encouraged to make SAXS measurements at other bioSAXS
beamlines in the US. Information on these beamlines is provided below. We will
provide some BioCAT supported time at these facilities, and users can also
directly apply for beamtime with these facilities at any time.

BioCAT supported beamtime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BioCAT beamline scientists will work with other facilities to support a limited
number of user experiments during the dark period. The goal is to help alleviate
burden on facility staff due to a possible increased user demand on other
facilities. Every few months BioCAT will work with a different beamline to
schedule about a week of time at the beamline. BioCAT will solicit interest
from our users, help them plan the experiments, and then the users will apply
directly to the facility for beamtime. Assuming enough of BioCAT users get
awarded beamtime, the facility will schedule the BioCAT users as a contiguous
block of time. A BioCAT scientist will travel to the facility during that block
to help support our users' experiments. We will also assist them after the
experiment with data processing/analysis as needed. These BioCAT blocks at a
given facility will be announced through our user mailing list.


If you want to know more about this BioCAT supported time at other facilities
`contact Max Watkins <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_.

Users are also encouraged to directly apply to different SAXS beamlines for
time if their experiments can't be accommodated in our focused slots these
other facilities. BioCAT staff are happy to assist with these experiments as we can,
such as with experiment planning and data analysis.

General notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   Other beamlines and the NIH are interested in tracking where BioCAT users
    go for beamtime during the APS-U dark period. In order to facilitate this,
    if you are a BioCAT user who is submitting a proposal at a beamline you
    haven’t used before we ask that you put “BioCAT” in the proposal title
    when submitting proposals to another facility (e.g. “SAXS to study protein
    ABC – BioCAT”). This will also help us provide more support for these
    experiments at these other facilities.

*   We recommend adding a radical scavenger to your buffer for experiments at
    other facilities (unlike at BioCAT). So you should consider a reductant or
    1-2% glycerol to protect against radiation damage.

*   Other beamlines have different q ranges, particularly the minimum q. This
    minimum q sets the maximum size of a macromolecule that can be measured at
    the beamline, as Dmax = pi/qmin. Users should be aware that some macromolecules
    that can be measured at BioCAT (qmin ~0.0027 1/Å, Dmax ~1160 Å) will not be
    measurable at other beamlines, so check the q ranges for each beamline if
    you have large objects

*   BioCAT currently does not plan to do time resolved experiments using our
    setup at any other beamline during the dark period, due to limitations of
    experimental capabilities at other beamlines and/or available beamtime.
