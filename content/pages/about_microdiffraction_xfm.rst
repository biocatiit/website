.. lead::   The BioCAT micro-Diffraction and X-ray Florescent Microscopy(XFM)
            instruments are highly efficient tools for X-ray elemental mapping
            and micro-X-ray Diffraction studies of biological samples.

Areas of interest up to a few mm2 in tissue sections can be scanned to
determine metal distributions with 2-3 µm resolution in XFM configuration.
Several metals (10 or more) can be probed simultaneously with a minimum of
sample preparation. Low-resolution maps may be performed initially over
larger areas to determine smaller areas of interest that will subsequently
be scanned at higher resolutions. This approach maximizes the efficiency
of the microprobe, spending beamtime selectively where it is most needed.
A 4 element, large active-area silicon drift detector system combined with
the fast scanning capabilities of the BioCAT beamline allow use of fast
scanning protocols to determine elemental maps of large area samples in
relatively short periods of time.

The useful d-space range from the micro-Diffraction instrument is 1/200 -
1/3.4 Å-1 at 12 keV and 1/900-1/20 Å-1 at 8 keV with the modified Mar 165
detector with 40 mm pixels (60 mm psf function for phosphor) for very
high-resolution data when the microbeam is focused at the detector.

Samples may be freeze- or air-dried and our Linkam cryostage can maintain
frozen hydrated samples at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
