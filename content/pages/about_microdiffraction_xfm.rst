We are currently developing micro-diffraction capabilities that will allow
examination of ordered structures in regions as small as 1 x 0.2 μm\ :sup:`2`.
Applications include, for example, mapping amyloid structures in brain tissues
that may be associated with neurodegenerative disease and collagen arrangements
in connective tissue that may be associated with a wide range of pathologies.
Scanning diffraction imaging can be done with either the standard `SAXS instrument,
the Micro-SAXS camera or the Micro-WAXS instruments <{filename}/pages/about_fiber.rst>`_
Samples can be either untreated, fixed, or freeze dried. The sample holders are
mounted on a high-resolution X-Y stage (Newport ILS 50PP with 1 μm resolution
and submicron accuracy) for raster scanning the sample. Sample movement and
X-ray exposures are controlled with a custom python script that triggers the
X-ray exposure at each data point with diffraction patterns collected on the
modified Mar165 CCD detector.  The sequence of tiff images may be analyzed
by the Diffraction Imaging (DI) module of the BioCAT developed `MuscleX data
reduction package <https://musclex.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_. The
microdiffraction imaging instrument is currently under development and
ot available for general users but can be made available through collaboration
with BioCAT staff.
