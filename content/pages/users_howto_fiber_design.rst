You need to know the first order resolution needed and the highest resolution
needed in order to have interpretable data for your system. Then the task is to
select a camera length and a size that allows both of these to be achieved. To
make this simple, please use our X-Ray Tools Q Calculator.

Enter the X-ray energy in KeV and a trial camera length in mm. Knowing the
dimensions of the backstop and the detector active area, one can find the optimal
camera length for your application by adjusting it in the application by trial
and error.

The following detectors are available at the beamline:

*   The Pilatus 3 1M detector has approximately 1k x 1k 172 µm pixels (169 x 179
    mm active area) and can be read out at 500fps.
*   The Pilatus 100k detector has 497 x 195 172 µm pixels (83.8 x 33.5 mm
    active area) and can be read out at 200 fps
*   The MAR165 CCD detector* has a circular active area 165 mm in diameter with
    pixels just under 80 microns square (2x2 binned). Can also be used unbinned
    for 4k x 4k 40 micron pixels.

For small angle fiber diffraction experiments, the available range of camera
lengths go from approximately 1 to 5m with 2-3 m being the most commonly used
length. The minimum beamstop size that is practical to use with the standard
small-angle camera is 3.2 mm.

Available equipment for muscle diffraction include a horizontal X-ray
diffraction/laser diffraction/muscle mechanics rig as well as small sample
cells allowing rapid sample changing with sarcomere length set by video
microscopy. Please contact Thomas Irving or Weikang Ma to discuss your needs
for muscle experiments. A short introduction to the basis of the equatorial
X-ray diffraction pattern from muscle can be found here:

BioCAT Microdiffraction capabilities are described in Barrea, et al.

Please contact Weikang Ma to discuss use of this instrument.

Experimenters are encouraged to contact Thomas Irving or Weikang Ma for muscle
diffraction questions; or Joseph Orgel with any questions regarding general
fiber diffraction. We are capable of accommodating a very wide variety of
sample chambers, laser setups, etc.
