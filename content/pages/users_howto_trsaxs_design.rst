How to design a time-resolved SAXS experiment

The most powerful use of SAXS is in the real time study of biological
macromolecules undergoing structural changes in response to a variety of
conditions such as denaturant / renaturant concentrations, ionic strength,
ligand binding, enzyme-substrate interactions etc.... Different types of mixer-
technologies give access to different time regimes (Fig. 1). These mixers have
traditionally been used in combination with spectroscopic techniques such as
Fluorescence Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) which yield valuable information
about localized structural alterations in response to changes in the micro-
environment. We have successfully combined these mixing techniques with
specifically designed SAXS cameras at BioCAT. Our time-resolved instruments
give us the ability to investigate global structural changes in real time and
also capture intermediates that are difficult to detect using other techniques.
We have three different time-resolved SAXS instruments.

Stopped-Flow
=============

We have an SFM-400 (Bio-logic science instruments) stopped-flow instrument
equipped with a flow cell containing a 1 mm quartz capillary with 10µm walls
specifically tailored for SAXS (Fig.2). We have achieved a dead-time of ~1 ms
and can extend data collection to a few hundred milliseconds depending on the
radiation sensitivity of samples. The Pilatus3 1M detector, with a 1 ms readout
time affords us optimal temporal resolution. Stopped-flow SAXS is the only
time-resolved instrument that operates on the main beamline optics (beam size -
~150 µm horizontal X 75 µm vertical).

Chaotic/Turbulent Flow
===========================

The main disadvantages of stopped-flow SAXS are a very high likelihood of
radiation damage of the static plugs of liquid and low signal to noise ratios
due to the extremely brief exposures needed for optimal temporal resolution.
Continuous flow mixers are an alternative which depend on the mixing of two or
more streams of fluid followed by an observation channel the distance in which
corresponds to the age of the mixture. While continuous flow is an obvious
strategy to circumvent radiation damage and signal to noise issues, sample
consumption tends to be high. However, developmental efforts over the past few
years at BioCAT have resulted in significantly smaller beams using a compound
refractive lens (CRL - 20µm horizontal X 5µm vertical), which in turn has enabled
us to design much smaller microfluidic chips that reduce sample consumption by
orders of magnitude (10-50 mg of sample). The latest version of the mixer can be
used to measure time regimes in the ~100 µs to 75 ms range. Our
optimized system consisting of the CRL, a quartz mixer with ideal optical
properties, efficient fluid delivery systems (Harvard syringe pumps and
Teledyne ISCO HPLC pumps), and a fast readout photon counting detector
(Pilatus3 1M) can be deployed every run upon request and appropriate vetting
of the experimental systems, which must be initiated by contacting beam line
personnel.


Laminar Flow
=============

We have also developed a laminar flow mixer that is compatible with our CRL
SAXS setup. Laminar flow mixers use hydrodynamic focusing to mix multiple
streams of liquid and is able to do so at much lower flow speeds compared to
turbulent / chaotic flow mixers. Sample consumption is therefore considerably
lower, however, the extremely small sample profiles generated by hydrodynamic
focusing result in sub-optimal signal to noise ratios therefore necessitating
use of much higher concentrations. The time regimes that can be sampled using
laminar flow mixers ranges from ~1 ms to 1.5 s. As with the
other two time-resolved SAXS techniques, there is a particular need for
preparatory rigor and is therefore important to discuss the experiments with
beamline personnel well in advance.
