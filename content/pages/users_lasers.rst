    "Most lasers are capable of causing eye injury to anyone who looks directly
    into the beam or specular reflection. Even diffuse reflections of a high-power
    laser beam can produce permanent eye damage. High-power laser beams can burn
    exposed skin, ignite flammable materials, and vaporize materials, possibly
    releasing hazardous fumes, vapors, or gases. The equipment and optical
    apparatus required to produce the lasing action and control and direct the
    laser beam may introduce additional hazards. These hazards may include high
    voltage, high pressure, cryogenics, noise, radiation, and toxic fluids."
