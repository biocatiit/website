    "Most lasers are capable of causing eye injury to anyone who looks directly
    into the beam or specular reflection. Even diffuse reflections of a high-power
    laser beam can produce permanent eye damage. High-power laser beams can burn
    exposed skin, ignite flammable materials, and vaporize materials, possibly
    releasing hazardous fumes, vapors, or gases. The equipment and optical
    apparatus required to produce the lasing action and control and direct the
    laser beam may introduce additional hazards. These hazards may include high
    voltage, high pressure, cryogenics, noise, radiation, and toxic fluids."

    --- Chapter 6, ES and H Manual

Below is an incomplete listing of the requirements for using a laser at BioCAT.
This document is still under construction. To be **CERTAIN** you have fulfilled all
the requirements, contact Weikang Ma.

*   Class I

    No requirements

*   Class II

    Laser Safety Training ESH-121 (Low Power) Recommended

*   Class IIIa

    Laser Safety Training (either ESH-121 or ESH-120) Required
    Laser Safety Officer Approval

*   Class IIIb

    Standard Operating Procedure
    Laser Safety Training (ESH-120) Required
    Eye Exam

*   Class IV
    Standard Operating Procedure
    Laser Safety Training (ESH-120) Required
    Eye Exam

Explanation of terms:

*   Laser Safety Training

    Anyone using a class III or IV laser must take the ANL-specific Laser Safety class.
    If ESH-120 will satisfy the requirement, this course can be taken through an ANL web-page.
    Otherwise, both courses are taught by ANL's Laser Safety Officer:

    Bruce Murdoch

    \(630) 252 4905

    btmurdoch@anl.gov

    and is scheduled through:

    Sue Dornfeld

    \(630) 252 6323

    ssdornfeld@anl.gov

*   The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
    The SOP becomes the official safety document for the specific laser being
    used for a specific experiment. It must be revised for every experiment. A
    template can be found here. To fill it out, you will need to know:

    *   Description of the Laser Controlled Area (LCA)

        Where the LCA is and how it will be controlled.

    *   Normal Laser Operation

        Components of set-up, lay-out of set-up (specifically where the output
        of the laser is directed, where the optical components are located, how
        the beam is terminated, where the emergency stop is located, how the
        beam is enclosed, and the height of the beam), and technical specifications
        of each laser to be used.

    *   Eyewear

        The protective eyewear to be used in the LCA.

    *   Alignment Procedure

        Be detailed. ANL is currently (Spring 2002) paying especial attention
        to alignment procedures in the SOP.

    *   Laser Hazard Control

        *   Door interlock systems
        *   Window Covers
        *   Warning Signs
        *   Prevention of Unauthorized operation
        *   Invisible "beam on" indicator
        *   Emergency cut-off switch

    *   Associated Hazards

        Such things as electrical and chemical hazards.

    *   Emergency Managment

*   Eye Exam

    The Eye Exam is required to document any existing damage. The medical
    record is kept on file here at ANL's Medical Department. Our liason there is:

    Karen Souders

    \(630) 252 2809

    ksouders@anl.gov

    A copy of the Special Eye Examination Sheet must be provided to both the
    Medical Department and BioCAT.

    *   On-Site

        *   Payment

            If you elect to generate the medical record here at ANL, the
            requested extortion fee is $80. This needs to be paid by an Internal
            Purchase Order and, therefore, requires you to set up an ANL account.
            Contact Deana Kinzler (630) 252 1244 to set up this account.

            Once the account is set up, JoAnne Wold (630) 252 9494 should be
            able to help you generate the PO.

        *   Exam

            Once a PO has been issued, contact the Medical Department to schedule
            an exam. The exam is conducted just off-site in LaGrange near LaGrange
            hospital:

            Dr. Fick

            Room 203, LaGrage Eye Associates

            1323 Memorial Dr.

            LaGrange, IL

            \(708) 352 7422

    *   Off-Site
        You may elect to have your exam taken off-site at a preferred medical
        center. The physician must fill out ANL's Special Eye Examination Sheet
        which may be requested from the ANL Medical Department.
