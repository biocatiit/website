**Computing at BioCAT**

As an experimenter at BioCAT, you are welcome to bring your personal devices (laptop, iPad, phone, etc) for use during your time at BioCAT.  All computing at BioCAT is done as part of the larger Argonne network – your network traffic is being monitored.

When you arrive at BioCAT, your work will require the use of our desktop computers for data collection and analysis. As a User, you may not install any software on BioCAT computers without the consent of the BioCAT System Administrator, Mark Vukonich.

You may use our local network for your personal computing with your computing devices (data analysis, emails, network browsing).  Our network supports DHCP, so your device should be automatically assigned an IP Address once you connect to our local network via RJ-45 ethernet.  

**Wireless**

You may choose to use the `Argonne’s Guest Wireless Network <https://www.anlgh.org/accommodations/computer-and-network-access>`_ or the Eduroam Wireless Network, which is also accessible at Argonne.  Please note, that if you are using the Argonne Guest wireless network or Eduroam on a particular device, that device will not be able to connect with devices on our local hardwired BioCAT network.  You must be on the local BioCAT subnet connected via RJ-45 for data transfer, etc.

**Data Retrieval**

BioCAT is now integrated with the Globus Secure ftp system and we are able to provide access to your data once your experiment ends.  When your beamtime is complete, you may request that we upload your data to the Globus system.  Once your data is uploaded – you will be sent instructions for configuring Globus on your system and retrieving your data.  If you are not an approved User on your groups’ ESAF, you will not have access to datasets.

You may also choose to bring a USB 3, 2-5TB external hard-drive to copy your data while you are conducting your experiment.

*Some important things to note:*

*    BioCAT will retain User Data for a minimum of two years. After two years data will be retained based on available storage space.

*    Please verify the completeness of your data copy immediately after your visit to BioCAT so that we may send you any files that are corrupt/ missing.

*    While at BioCAT, you are using Federal networks and computing systems (yes, `you are being watched <https://www.anl.gov/privacy-security-notice>`_).

*    If you are using a computer with a legacy operating system or software, you will not be able to access the World Wide Web from our local network — however, all locally networked computers on the BioCAT subnet will be able to connect with all BioCAT computing resources. (Legacy systems using the Argonne Wireless will not be affected).
