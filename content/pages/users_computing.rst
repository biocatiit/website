As an experimenter at BioCAT, you are responsible for arranging for the collection
of your data for your personal use. At the present time, you must copy all data
that you generate during your visit to a sufficiently large storage device before
your departure.

We recommend a USB 3, >=1 TB, external hard drive, as these are now widely
available and reasonably priced. You may also use your personal laptop; however,
the amount of data you collect may be large, and the size of most laptop hard-drives
is relatively small.

When you arrive at BioCAT, your work will require the use of our desktop computers
for data collection and analysis. As a User, you may not install any software on
BioCAT computers without the consent of the BioCAT System Administrator.

You may use our local network for your personal computing with your computing
devices (data analysis, emails, network browsing). Our network supports DHCP,
so your device should be automatically assigned an IP Address once you connect
to our local network via RJ45. You may also choose to use the Argonne wireless
network. Please note, that if you are using the Argonne wireless network on a
particular device, that device will not be able to connect with our local hardwired
BioCAT network. You must be on the local BioCAT subnet for data transfer, etc.

Some important things to note:

*   BioCAT only retains User Data for a maximum of 6 months
*   Please verify the completeness of your data copy immediately after your visit to
    BioCAT so that we may send you any files that are corrupt/ missing
*   While at BioCAT, you are using Federal networks and computing systems (yes,
    `you are being watched <http://www.anl.gov/privacy-security-notice>`_)
*   If you are using a computer with a legacy operating system or software, you will
    not be able to access the World Wide Web from our local network -- however, all
    locally networked computers on the BioCAT subnet will be able to connect with all
    BioCAT computing resources. (Legacy systems using the Argonne Wireless will not be affected)
