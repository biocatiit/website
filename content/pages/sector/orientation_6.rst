*If you have questions regarding our facility that are not adequately answered
on this website, please feel free to ask questions.*

Compressed Gas Cylinders
=================================

Compressed gas cylinders can present many hazards if handled improperly.
Cylinders in use must be secured to a rigid surface to prevent tipping over,
and fitted with a proper regulator. When not in use, cylinders must be capped.
Use of hazardous gases is allowed only within the guidelines specified in your
ESAF. Consult a member of the BioCAT staff for assistance.

Liquid Nitrogen and Dry-Ice (Cryogenic) Safety
================================================

If you need to use liquid nitrogen please ask a BioCAT staff member. When
working with liquid nitrogen, you must wear waterproof cryogenic gloves, a
cryogenic apron, and a full face shield. You must also work to mitigate splash
hazards. Do not dispose of liquid nitrogen in any sinks.

If you need to use dry-ice, you must wear waterproof cryogenic gloves and
safety goggles. Do not dispose of dry-ice in any sinks.

Tricycle usage
================================================

Each tricycle at the APS belongs to a specific sector/group. Our group operates
two tricycles that have a 'BioCAT, Sector-18' identification plate on the rear
basket. Please do not use tricycles that belong to other beamlines. Control
your speed when riding, (should not exceed a fast walking pace) and return the
tricycle to BioCAT when you are finished.

Pedestrian Safety
================================================

Pedestrians in the experimental hall share the walkways with a variety of
motorized/moving vehicles, such as forklifts, scissor lifts, and tricycles.
Please exercise caution, and look both ways before stepping into a walkway
from the labs, offices, or beamline areas.

Meals
================================================

Building 435 has a kitchenette, which you may use. Some users who are running
longer experiments prefer to buy groceries offsite and store them in the
kitchenette on the counter and in the refrigerator. Please keep your groceries
neat and organized. Throw away any garbage and clean up your messes. You may
also dine in our conference room, in the corner of our office, or have a
light snack at the beamline workstation.
