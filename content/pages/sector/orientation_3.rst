911 and Emergencies
===================

In an emergency, you may dial 911 from any Argonne landline telephone, or
630-252-1911 from a personal cell phone. This will connect you with the
Argonne Onsite Emergency operator.

If you need assistance out on the experimental floor, tell the operator the 
column number of Sector 18 - which is Column 118.

If you are in the LOM, tell the operator the Building number, which is 435B.

What constitutes an emergency?

For example:

#.  Any injury which requires medical assistance
#.  A security issue where people may be endangered
#.  A hazardous material chemical spill

Do not hesitate! If you feel that a potentially dangerous situation exists,
place the call. It will be answered by the ANL Fire Department which is on-site,
and will also be monitored by the Argonne Protective Force.

Fires, Tornadoes, and Other
===========================

Fire Extinguishers
------------------

You will see fire extinguishers in locations around APS. These are only to be
used by firemen and those who have received the official ANL fire extinguisher
training. Do not attempt to fight fires yourself. Please call 911 in a fire
situation.

The APS has a two-stage fire alarm system. If you hear a fire alarm out on the
experimental floor where the beamlines are, move to the LOM (Lab-Office Module)
areas. If the fire alarms are also ringing in these areas, you will be given
instructions on what nature of the emergency. If it is a fire and you are
being asked to leave the building - proceed to the nearest emergency exit,
turn right once outside, and continue to the assembly area on the far side
of building 440 (Center for Nanoscale Materials). If it is a tornado, please
go to the nearest mens' or womens' bathroom as these are the tornado shelters.
