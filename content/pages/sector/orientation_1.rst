Introduction
=================================

This is part one of a two-part sector orientation. Please read through the
following slides carefully. They contain valuable information about the rules
and safety features you need to be aware of in your upcoming experience at
BioCAT, Sector 18. At the conclusion, you will be asked to verify that you
have read and understood all of this material and you will have to take a
short quiz. You are responsible for understanding everything in this
orientation and working within the bounds of what is in your ESAF, so if you
do not understand something, please ask!

Part two of your orientation will include a brief tour and verification of
operational procedures with a member of the BioCAT Staff. Please feel free
to ask any questions regarding this material at any time during your stay.

Upon arrival, no one may start work at BioCAT or be allowed in either the
Hutches or the Wet-Lab until the following conditions are met:

#.  Users must take all required APS Safety Courses designated by the ESAF and
    BioCAT staff.

#.  BioCAT staff must confirm that that all users present match the user list
    in the ESAF and that all training modules have been taken. If any users
    are absent or are additional, they must be added or subtracted
    electronically by BioCAT staff. Absent users should be marked as 'off-site'.
    BioCAT staff must then administer the Sector-Specific Orientation (Sector
    Orientation) and obtain signed sheets from users.

#.  The ESAF must be printed and verified as to the accuracy of scope and
    materials included within.

#.  Finally, a floor coordinator must arrive to meet and be physically present
    to authorize users to initiate work and post the ESAF.
