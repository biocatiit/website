on this website, please feel free to ask questions.*

Introduction
============

This is part one of a two-part sector orientation. Please read through the
following slides carefully. They contain valuable information about the rules
and safety features you need to be aware of in your upcoming experience at
BioCAT, Sector 18. At the conclusion, you will be asked to verify that you
have read and understood all of this material and you will have to take a
short quiz. You are responsible for understanding everything in this
orientation and working within the bounds of what is in your ESAF, so if you
do not understand something, please ask!

Part two of your orientation will include a brief tour and verification of
operational procedures with a member of the BioCAT Staff. Please feel free
to ask any questions regarding this material at any time during your stay.

Upon arrival, no one may start work at BioCAT or be allowed in either the
Hutches or the Wet-Lab until the following conditions are met:

#.  Users must take all required APS Safety Courses designated by the ESAF and
    BioCAT Staff.

#.  Users must wear their badge and dosimeter when conducting an experiment at
    Argonne. Dosimeters should be returned to the rack(located by the 435
    entry door leading to the parking lot) if Users leave the facility for any 
    reason and worn again at heart height when the User returns.

#.  BioCAT Staff must confirm that that all Users present match the user list
    in the ESAF and that all training modules have been taken. If any Users
    are absent or are additional, they must be added or subtracted
    electronically by BioCAT Staff. Absent Users should be marked as 'off-site'.
    BioCAT staff must then administer the Sector-Specific Orientation (Sector
    Orientation) and obtain signed sheets from Users. For Users who will be 
    arriving later, BioCAT Staff should make a notation on the paper copy of 
    the ESAF to be posted noting the day and approximate time of arrival and 
    the Floor Coordinator should be notified of this. 

#.  The ESAF must be printed and verified with the User Group as to the accuracy 
    of scope and materials included within. If any materials need to be added to the ESAF,
    this is an appropriate time to do so. Materials can be added at any time
    during the course of the experiment (if the User would like to use a
    chemical in the BioCAT chemical inventory, for instance) but that material
    will not be available for use until the ameded ESAF is approved. 

#.  Finally, a Floor Coordinator should be paged by BioCAT Staff to come to 
    Sector 18 to post the ESAF.  The Floor Coordinator will arrive when they are
    able to meet and be physically present to authorize users to initiate work and post the ESAF.
