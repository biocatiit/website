Safe Conduct of Experimental Work
=================================

Stop Work Policy
--------------------

Everyone at Argonne has what is called, "Stop Work Authority." That means that
if you see a potentially unsafe situation, you should tell those working to
"Stop Work" so that the unsafe situation can be made safe or corrected. If
a potentially unsafe situation occurs, you should alert BioCAT staff after
using your 'Stop Work' Authority. If you are not comfortable speaking to
them directly, find a staff member for assistance, or dial 911. If at any time
you encounter a potentially hazardous situation, or if you're not comfortable
performing a task, stop what you're doing and ask a member of the staff for
assistance.

Experiment Safety Guidelines
--------------------------------

The ESAF (Experimental Safety Assessment Form) is the safety paperwork
detailing 'who' will be doing 'what' during your visit to BioCAT. It authorizes
the users listed to do a particular set of experiments with a particular set
of chemicals and equipment. Any deviations from what is listed in the ESAF
must be reported to BioCAT staff before they occur, so that the ESAF may be modified
and re-approved.

Things that must be reported to BioCAT staff so that the ESAF can be modified
include:

#.  Additions or subtractions of the users listed on the ESAF.
#.  Additions or subtractions in the chemicals or samples required for the experiment.
#.  Additions or subtractions in the equipment required for the experiment.
#.  Adjustments to the protocols (SOP's) outlined in the ESAF.

All users on-site must abide by the experimental plans outlined in their ESAF(s).
The ESAF will be printed by BioCAT staff once all Users are present and ready
to begin work. Users will be asked to review their ESAF(s) and verify
participants, samples and chemicals, equipment, and protocols. Your
ESAF(s) will be posted near your experiment -- either on the D-hutch door, or
on the wet-lab door by the APS floor coordinator before you are permitted to
start any work at APS.
