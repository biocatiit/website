Safe Conduct of Experimental Work
=================================

Stop Work Policy
----------------

Everyone at Argonne has what is called, "Stop Work Authority." That means that
if you see a potentially unsafe situation, you should feel authorized to 
prevent an accident from happening by tell those working to "Stop Work" so that 
the unsafe situation can be made safe or corrected. 

If a potentially unsafe situation occurs, you should alert BioCAT Staff after
using your 'Stop Work' Authority. If you are not comfortable using your "Stop Work"
authority for any reason - please, find a BioCAT Staff member or you may feel free 
to call a Floor Coordinator (2-0101) for assistance. If at any time, you are not
comfortable performing a task, stop what you're doing and ask a member of the staff for
assistance.

Experiment Safety Guidelines
----------------------------

The ESAF (Experimental Safety Assessment Form) is the safety paperwork
detailing 'who' will be doing 'what' during your visit to BioCAT. It authorizes
the users listed to do a particular set of experiments with a particular set
of chemicals and equipment. 

**No User may begin work or enter the Wet-Lab, Dry-Lab, or Experimental Floor Area
and D-hutch before their ESAF has been posted!**

If you have samples that need immediate attention to be transferred into a Wet-Lab 
freezer or refridgerator, please ask a BioCAT Staff member to do this for you.

Any deviations from what is listed in the ESAF scope, materials, or equipment
must be reported to BioCAT Staff before they occur, so that the ESAF may be modified
and re-approved.

Things that must be reported to BioCAT Staff so that the ESAF can be modified
include:

#.  Additions or subtractions of the users listed on the ESAF.
#.  Additions or subtractions in the chemicals or samples required for the experiment.
#.  Additions or subtractions in the equipment required for the experiment.
#.  Adjustments to the protocols (SOP's) outlined in the ESAF.

**All Users on-site must abide by the experimental plans outlined in their ESAF(s).**

User will assemble in the BioCAT Conference Room in the BioCAT LOM for a pre-experiment
check-in where the ESAF will be printed by BioCAT Staff once all Users are present and ready
to begin work. Users will be asked to review their ESAF(s) and verify participants, 
samples and chemicals, equipment, and protocols. Youra ESAF(s) will be posted near 
your experiment -- either on the D-hutch door, or on the Wet-Lab door(for Wet-Lab only/ 
no Xray ESAFs) by the APS Floor Coordinator before you are permitted to start any work at APS.
