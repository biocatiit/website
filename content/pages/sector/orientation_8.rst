Wet-Lab, continued...
=================================

Ice
---------

BioCAT has an ice machine in the wet-lab. If you will be needing a lot of ice
for your experiment, there is a large ice machine in the APCF adjacent to
building 435. The entrance is across from the mens' room. Please ask and
BioCAT staff will show you where it is.

Sharps
----------

When working with sharps (i.e. razor blades, syringes, etc.), do not leave
them sit out on the counter when not in use. Instead, keep them on a spill
tray toward the back of the counter when not in immediate use. When your work
is complete, dispose of sharps in one of the containers marked for sharps
disposal in the lab.

Chemical Waste
----------------

If you are generating chemical waste that you intend to leave behind, it must
be properly packaged and documented on a waste form before you depart APS.
See Mark Vukonich or another member of the BioCAT staff for guidance before
you start working with chemicals and sample materials.

Shipping
----------

If you wish to ship any samples, chemicals, or equipment to the beamline
ahead of your scheduled run, there is a very specific process that you must
follow. The instructions for shipping items to BioCAT can be found in the `User Info
section of our website <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_.

Shipping materials out from ANL is a complex process and you must involve BioCAT 
Staff for guidance regarding the shipment of items back to your home institution. 
If you would like to ship samples, chemicals and/or hardware back to your home 
institution when your run concludes, you will need to package your materials safely, 
and provide a complete list if items inside of the package along with links to the
relevant MSDS Forms to Mark Vukonich. All packages will be inspected prior to 
beginning the shipping process.

If you need assistance, see Mark Vukonich.
