Wet-Lab, continued...
=================================

Ice
---------

BioCAT has an ice machine in the wet-lab. If you will be needing a lot of ice
for your experiment, there is a large ice machine in the APCF adjacent to
building 435. The entrance is across from the mens' room. Please ask and
BioCAT staff will show you where it is.

Sharps
----------

When working with sharps (i.e. razor blades, syringes, etc.), do not leave
them sit out on the counter when not in use. Instead, keep them on a spill
tray toward the back of the counter when not in immediate use. When your work
is complete, dispose of sharps in one of the containers marked for sharps
disposal in the lab.

Chemical Waste
----------------

If you are generating chemical waste that you intend to leave behind, it must
be properly packaged and documented on a waste form before you depart APS.
See Mark Vukonich or another member of the BioCAT staff for guidance before
you start working with chemicals and sample materials.

Shipping
----------

If you wish to ship your samples, chemicals, or equipment to the beamline
ahead of your scheduled run, please follow the instructions in the `User Info
section of our website <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_.

Shipping materials out from ANL can be a complex process. If you would like to
ship chemicals and/or hardware back to your home institution when your run
concludes, you should fill out a blank FedEx form and package your materials
(according to DOT Shipping Regulations) for pickup by the Building 435 Entrance.
If you need assistance, see Mark Vukonich.
