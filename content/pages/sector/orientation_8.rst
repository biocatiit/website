Wet-Lab, continued...
=====================

Ice
---

BioCAT has an ice machine located in the Wet-Lab. If you will be needing a lot of ice
for your experiment, there is a large ice machine in the APCF adjacent to
building 435. The entrance is across from the mens' room. Please ask and
BioCAT staff will show you where it is.

Dry-Ice
-------

If you will need dry-ice for your experiment, please let a member of BioCAT Staff
know and we can get it for you.

Sharps
------

**Manage your sharps properly!** When working with sharps (i.e. dissecting tools, pins,
razor blades, syringes, etc.), do not leave them sit out on the counter when not in use.
Instead, keep them on a spill tray toward the back of the counter when not in immediate
use. When your work is complete, dispose of sharps in one of the containers marked for sharps
disposal in the lab.

Carcass/ Tissue Waste
---------------------

The proper way to dispose of carcasses/ non-BLS2 tissues is to wrap them in a lab diaper
and put them into a plastic bag - marking the bag with the type of contents of the carcass/
tissue waste and writing the name of the PI and with the date. (ie. pig heart, Smith 02/24/2024)
Then place that bag in the -20C Freezer located in the Wet-Lab.  Larger bags may be used for
multiple carcasses/ tissues.

Chemical Waste
--------------

If you have included and been approved for any hazardous chemical use as part
of your experiment, the waste must be properly packaged and documented on a
waste form before you depart APS. See Mark Vukonich for instructions on how to
properly store hazardous waste while conducting your experiment before your
experiment begins. Do not pour any waste hazardous chemicals down the sink drain.

Shipping
--------

If you wish to ship any samples, chemicals, or equipment to the beamline
ahead of your scheduled run, there is a very specific process that you must
follow. The instructions for shipping items to BioCAT can be found in the `User Info
section of our website <{filename}/pages/users_shipping.rst>`_.

Shipping materials out from ANL can also be a complex process and you must involve BioCAT
Staff for guidance regarding the shipment of items back to your home institution.

If you would like to ship samples, chemicals and/or hardware back to your home
institution when your run concludes, you will need to package your materials safely,
and provide a complete list of items inside of the package along with links to the
relevant MSDS Forms to a member of BioCAT Staff(Mark or Rick). All packages will be
inspected prior to beginning the shipping process.
