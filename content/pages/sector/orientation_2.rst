Access and Authorized Areas
=================================

You are a visitor at Argonne National Labs, and as such are restricted as to
where you may be while at the APS/ Argonne. The APS operates on a 'CAT' system.
All CATS at the APS are actually separate entities, so you only have access
to the BioCAT Beamline, BioCAT Computers, as well as the common areas and
common hallways of the APS. You may not wander into the offices or experimental
areas of 'other' (non-BioCAT) beamlines. You may not use any non-BioCAT
computers except for your personal ones. Doing so constitutes a security
violation and will be reported to the heads of Argonne Security and investigated.
If you are found to be in violation of these policies, quite possibly you will
never be allowed on site again.

As a user of BioCAT, you only have authorized access to those areas of Argonne
which pertain to your experiment. This includes:

#.  The common areas and hallways of the APS.
#.  The Argonne Guest House and Cafeteria.
#.  The BioCAT LOM(Offices).
#.  BioCAT wet and dry labs.
#.  BioCAT experimental floor.

You are required to wear your APS/ Argonne badge so that it is visible. Also
wearing shorts and/or open-toes shoes are not allowed.

Argonne Phone Landlines
=================================
The BioCAT landline extension at the beamline is 2-1818. Notice that within the
Argonne campus, you may use the last 5 digits of the number that you wish to
call. The cell-phone numbers of BioCAT Staff are available at the beamline
console landline phone. To dial an external number, dial 71, then the area code
and number. Floor coordinators may be paged via the APS Website or they may
be paged by dialing 2-0101 from the beamline phone and 2-1818 in response
to a call-back number.
