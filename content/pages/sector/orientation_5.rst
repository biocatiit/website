Electrical and Equipment Safety
=================================

Device Inspections
--------------------

If you are bringing or have brought any devices (other than laptop/desktop
computers) to support your experiment, you must notify members of BioCAT staff,
so that they may be inspected. All electrical/mechanical/high-pressure/other
devices brought onsite are subject to the Argonne Electrical Safety and
Inspection Policy. This means that your devices cannot be connected to
power until they are approved by an ANL DEEI (Designated Electrical
Equipment Inspector). Please consult the BioCAT staff before powering up
any electrical device.

Electrical Work
--------------------------------

Users may connect approved devices to power, and use them as intended by
the manufacturer, and as outlined in the ESAF. However, users are not
permitted to perform any electrical repair or troubleshooting. Also, users
are restricted to working at or below 25 V (for wire connections) and never
while devices are energized (Mode Zero).

What does this mean? This means if you experience any issues with electrical
equipment while at Argonne, you are not authorized to repair it, so you should
get a member of BioCAT staff who is qualified (ANL Qualified Electrical Worker)
to repair it and notify them of the issues.

Areas Outlined in Yellow Tape

Yellow tape may be used on the floor to indicate a controlled-access area,
such as that surrounding an emergency electrical shutoff or an emergency exit
aisle. Do not leave anything (a chair, equipment, etc.) inside of a
yellow-taped-off area, and do not block the pathway into it.

Extension Cords
--------------------------------

If an extension cord is needed, you must make sure that it does not present
a trip hazard to any personnel. Also, extension cords are not to be daisy-chained
(one connected to another).
