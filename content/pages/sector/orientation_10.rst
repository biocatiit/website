*If you have questions regarding our facility that are not adequately answered
on this website, please feel free to ask questions.*

When Your Work is Complete
==========================

Clean any hardware and glassware you've used. Brushes and dish washing liquid
are available at the sink. Clean glassware and hardware may be left on the
drying rack. Please waste out any non-hazardous tubes, bottles, vials, buffers
that you generate during your visit. All hazardous waste needs to be reported
to BioCAT Staff to be stored and disposed of properly. Do not take any BioCAT
equipment home with you.

If you wish to ship any items back to your home institution, you must consult with
BioCAT Staff. Our `BioCAT Shipping Page for Users <https://www.bio.aps.anl.gov/pages/shipping.html>`_
outlines the process for shipping items out of Argonne back to your home institution.

You can prepare for shipping your items back by having a detailed list of the package 
contents which you will want to ship back, along with webpage links to any 
MSDS sheets which will be needed for shipping the items back. You will also
need your FedEx Account Number and Internal Billing Reference (if you use one).

End of Experiment Form
======================

As a courtesy, and to provide feedback to your beamline staff, please complete
an End of Experiment Form at the conclusion of your run.


Acknowledgments
===============

When publishing your work, you must acknowledge the APS, NIH, and BioCAT
according to the `guidelines found on our website <{filename}/pages/users_publications.rst>`_.


End of BioCAT Sector Orientation, part 1
