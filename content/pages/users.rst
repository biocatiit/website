As an experimenter at BioCAT, please read about the
`research techniques <{filename}/pages/about_biocat.rst>`_ BioCAT supports
to ensure that our capabilities are well matched to your requirements.

Once you've determined that BioCAT has the resources to further your research,
you will need to become familliar with the
`process for obtaining time <{filename}/pages/users_apply.rst>`_ at our beamline.

Prior to scheduling awarded time, it will be necessary to ensure that your
experiment satisfies all applicable safety and compliance requirements.

Please read through the material in each of these three categories as the
information contained within is there to help you make it smoothly through
the experiment process: from concept all the way through to data collection
and analysis.


Publications resulting for your research
=========================================

.. _user-pubs:

When you publish using data from BioCAT you need to:

*   Use the proper acknowledgment of the APS and BioCAT
*   Notify both the APS and BioCAT of such publications.

Peer-reviewed publications are are the primary measure of scientific output.
Properly documented publications insure that funds are avaliable to continue
operating the BioCAT facility.

The BioCAT facility is supported by the `National Institutes of Health <http://www.nih.gov/>`_
and, by law, all publications resulting from NIH support must adhere to the
`NIH public access policy <http://publicaccess.nih.gov/>`_:

    All final, peer-reviewed manuscripts must be posted to the `NIH Manuscript
    Submission System <http://www.nihms.nih.gov/>`_ upon acceptance for publication and
    be made publicly available on `PubMed Central <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/>`_
    no later than twelve months after the official date of publication.

    To comply, go to the `NIH Manuscript Submission System web page <http://publicaccess.nih.gov/>`_
    and follow their instructions. You will need to link your submission to a
    source of NIH funding. If you do not receive additional NIH support, you
    must attach your submission to the BioCAT grant: P41 GM103622 Thomas C. Irving PI.

In addition to the above, publications resulting from work performed at BioCAT are required to display the following acknowledgements:

    This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department
    of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office
    of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.
    "This project was supported by grant 9 P41 GM103622 from the National Institute
    of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health."

If you used the Pilatus 3 1M to acquire your data, please add the following:

    Use of the Pilatus 3 1M detector was provided by grant 1S10OD018090-01 from NIGMS.

This section should be added to the very end of acknowledgement:

    The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily
    reflect the official views of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
