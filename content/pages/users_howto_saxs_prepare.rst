In the following video from the Everything BioSAXS 5 workshop, Dr. Kushol Gupta
discusses what you need to know about sample preparation for SAXS

Checklist for SAXS sample preparation

#.  Buffer components

    #.  20-100 mM PBS, Tris,  HEPES, etc. PBS is preferred if possible.
    #.  Salt concentration <1M, typically 150-200 mM
    #.  Reducing agents (1-5 mM DTT or 1-2 mM TCEP) - good free radical scavengers.
    #.  Glycerol (1-5%, avoid greater than 10%)
    #.  Avoid detergents (use them below CMC)

#.  Buffer should be perfectly MATCHED

    #.  SEC-SAXS - make enough buffer for overnight equilibration for SEC-MALS-
        SAXS (> 1.5 L) and at least 2 column volumes for SEC-SAXS (> 500 mL).
    #.  Batch-mode SAXS - use dialysis buffer

#.  Sample (Protein or DNA/RNA) concentration and amount

    #.  Concentration: >5 mg/ml for proteins; 1-2 mg/ml for MALS only, Batch-
        mode SAXS - dilution series leading up to a maximum concentration of ~
        2mg/ml (could be higher for especially small proteins).
    #.  Minimum volume: SEC-MALS-SAXS / SEC-SAXS - 250 µL, Batch-mode SAXS -
        100 µl per concentration (at least three concentrations in the dilution
        series)

#.  Quality control: Pre-examination before X-ray scattering (Monodispersity)

    #.  Gel filtration (single and symmetric peak)
    #.  SDS-PAGE or Native GEL (single band)
    #.  Centrifugation or filter (> 15,000g * 10 mins)
    #.  Dynamic light scattering
    #.  Others

#.  Preparation of sample data-sheet
