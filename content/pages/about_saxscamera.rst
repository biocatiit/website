:title: Standard SAXS Camera Configurations

:slug: saxs-camera


SAXS cameras are used for both Small-Angle X-ray Solution Scattering (SAXS)
and fiber diffraction studies of muscle and connective tissue. While cameras
as short as 0.2 m and as long as 5.5 m are possible with the beamline optics,
we have standardized on a few selected camera lengths that match our available
detectors and commonly required Q-ranges. These camera lengths and Q-ranges
(detector offset) at 12 keV X-ray energy are given in Table 1. At the current
stage of development there is no great benefit in using cameras longer than
3.5 m. If the developments described in Technical R&D project 2 are successful
this can be revisited. Various combinations of stainless steel flight tube
sections allow a range of sample to detector distances. The flight tubes can
be moved in and out of position using overhead cranes. Mica windows are used
throughout except for the rear exit window, which is composed of 0.127 mm
thick Kapton film. The setup routinely uses a 4 mm diameter backstop with
an integrated single-element PIN photodiode for transmission measurements.
For SAXS experiments, the beam is defined by the collimator slits described
above. Three meters downstream of these slits are the guard slits Xenocs
"scatterless" slits) mounted on motorized horizontal and vertical
translation stages. This allows for accurate positioning and profiling of
the beam for diagnostic purposes. A number of different sample holders,
either supplied by the user or by BioCAT, can be mounted on crossed-roller
horizontal and vertical translation slides with 100 mm of travel and capable
of carrying up to 258 kg loads. Control of the sample holder position is
integrated with the detector control and data acquisition systems.
