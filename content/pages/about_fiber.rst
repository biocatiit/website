Capabilities for X-ray Fiber Crystallography
===============================================

We now have two mature, high-performance, instruments for fiber crystallography,
one based on the KB mirror micro-focusing optics described above, and the other
based on the collimated main beam. The useful d-space range from the micro-
diffraction instrument is 1/200 – 1/3.4 Å-1 at 12 keV and 1/900-1/20 Å-1 at 8
keV. Beam sizes and divergences for different focal positions are given in
Table 3. The beam can be focused at the detector for maximum X-ray pattern
data quality, the sample for maximum spatial resolution or somewhere in between
when compromises are necessary. The second instrument focuses the main beam at a
slit to give a well collimated 60 x 60 mm beam, which although is larger than
with the micro-diffraction instrument, is still small enough to find the ordered
domains in many samples. The advantage of this instrument is that it gives us
useful and simple setup for near small angle through to wide angle (1/160 Å-1
to 1/2 Å-1) with a low background and high signal to noise ratio. Another
advantage of this instrument is that it is more straightforward to change
camera lengths from 250 mm to 1m allowing for ranges of d spacing from 1/125
– 1/3.5 Å-1 (shortest camera) and 1/500-1/13 Å  (longest camera) at 12 keV.
The delicate crystallinity of user samples coupled with the high intensity
of the X-ray beam necessitates cryo capabilities. This is less straightforward
then for crystallography beamlines due to the sample sizes and nature (tissue
dissections, preparations, sections). To maintain fibrous samples at liquid
nitrogen temperature we have a custom cold nitrogen stream system made to our
specifications (it lacks the warm shield gas layer used in conventional
crystallography cryo-jets) by Cryo Industries of America. Leica CPC plunge-
freezing station for sample cryo-freezing / manipulation before being placed
in the cryo-jet stream.
