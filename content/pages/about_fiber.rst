    Many biological fibers such as muscle, hair, and viruses have internal structure
    which can be probed with X-rays. Using this technique, one can study the
    arrangement of proteins in muscle and tendons. It may be used to understand
    human maladies such as heart disease and cancer.

The `design features <{filename}/pages/about_beamline.rst>`_ of the BioCAT
beamline 18ID and the `source properties of the APS <https://ops.aps.anl.gov/SRparameters/SRparameters.html>`_
allow collection of fiber diffraction patterns of exceptional quality from complex,
weakly diffracting biological systems within very short exposure times. The
small focal spots achievable with this instrument (~15 x 25 μm\ :sup:`2`) have
allowed excellent discrimination of fine detail in fiber patterns from muscle,
connective tissue, and filamentous viruses as well as detection of weak
diffraction features in the presence of large backgrounds. The low divergence
of the undulator source and the independent horizontal and vertical focusing
of our optics simultaneously allows small beam spots at the sample and at the
detector that can be varied over a wide range. The high X-ray flux of this
instrument (~5.0 x 10\ :sup:`13` photons/s) together with the 550 Hz maximum
frame rate of the EIGER2 XE 9M detector permits dynamic experiments on these
systems with high time-resolution. The large active area of the EIGER2 XE
9M (233 by 245 mm\ :sup:`2`) allows access to wide q range at high spatial
resolution (75 µm).


Facilities for experiments on intact muscle
**********************************************

For combined intact skeletal muscle mechanics and X-ray measurements, we have
a vertical muscle mechanics apparatus equipped with one of 3 muscle lever
systems (Aurora Scientific 300B series) and a high-power muscle stimulator (Aurora
Scientific 701B). The muscle mechanics and X-ray measurements are synchronized
by triggering them both from a Dynamic Muscle Control system (Aurora Scientific 605A).

For online intact rat cardiac muscle mechanics and X-ray measurements, we have
a horizontal muscle mechanics apparatus equipped with a laser diffraction system
including a linear CCD sarcomere length computer system (Dexela Inc., UK), a
motor (Aurora Scientific 315C) and a force transducer (Aurora Scientific 400A).
The experimental protocol is controlled using a Real-Time Muscle Data Acquisition
System (Aurora Scientific model 600). The cardiac muscle fiber is perfused with
oxygenated Kreb-Henseleit solution by 2-Channel Minipulse Peristaltic Pump (Gilson
Inc). We also have a commercial Langendorf apparatus (Emka Technoligies) that
can be used for combined X-ray diffraction/physiological studies of whole,
beating rodent hearts under near physiological conditions.


Facilities for experiments on skinned muscle
**********************************************

For online skinned muscle mechanics and X-ray measurements we have a range of
horizontal muscle mechanics apparatuses equipped with a range of force
transducers (Aurora 400 series), and motors (Aurora Scientific 300 series) for
different force levels and response times. He/Ne laser diffraction is available
to measure sarcomere length just prior to performing the experiment.  We have
multiplexed physiology rigs where up to four muscle samples can be mounted at
the same time and interrogated sequentially. This also allows for much more
efficient experiments, especially when long incubation times are required.
The mechanical data can be monitored and recorded by either of our Aurora
data acquisition systems described above. These data are also recorded by the
main beamline data acquisition system. For remote controlled solution exchange,
we have two Hamilton Microlab 500 series dual syringe pumps equipped with
multiway valves. Temperature can be adjusted from 10 to 38 °C by a heat
exchanger in line with the inlet tubes to the muscle chambers. A PLA based
(LulzBot) and a high-resolution resin based (Elego Mars 2) 3D printer on site
allow for quick modification and fabrication of experimental chambers and setups
based on the users’ needs. We have two fast shutters, each capable of 1 ms
exposures, and sub-millisecond exposures can be achieved when both shutters are
used in tandem.


Facilities for Fiber Crystallography
***************************************

Fiber crystallography experiments can use either the standard SAXS instrument
using the main beamline optics or the micro-SAXS instrument. The standard SAXS
instrument is used when the samples are large and the highest first order
resolution required, e.g. experiments where the 67 nm first reflection of
collagen needs to be observed. The micro-SAXS instrument is built around a
1.85 m focal length Compound Refractive Lens (CRL) with an angular divergence
of 0.4 milliradians in both directions. The delivered flux is 2.2x10\ :sup:`12`
photons/s at 12 keV into a focal spot of 3 x 3 μm\ :sup:`2`. When used as a
fiber crystallography instrument, the beam focus can be located either at the
sample, for the highest spatial resolution in the sample plane or closer to the
detector plane for high angular resolution measurements. Our custom modified
MAR detector provides a large active area (165 mm image circle) with 40 μm
pixels (~60 μm point spread function for the phosphor) for high-resolution data.

The wide-angle fiber crystallography/XFM setup is built on its own optical
table at the rear of the experimental enclosure (It is built around a 50 cm
focal length CRL with an observed focal spot size of 1 x 0.2 μm\ :sup:`2` with
a delivered flux of ~ 6 x 10\ :sup:`11` photons/s. The short focal length
precludes applications where the beam is focused at the detector but provides
maximum spatial resolution at the sample position. Diffraction experiments
using this device will need to be able to tolerate the relatively high
divergence of the beam, ~ 2 milliradians in the detector plane.


Cryogenic sample handling
****************************

Capabilities include custom cryoPC cryojet which lacks the drying shield air
for large fibrous samples for flash freezing, and 2) a Leica cryo-workstation
with liquefied propane for plunge freezing of smaller samples. For the larger
tissue samples used in diffraction mapping experiments, we have a custom designed
cryo-stage that can maintain larger tissue sections at liquid nitrogen
temperature supplied by a liquid nitrogen delivery system (Cryofab model CLBP-25).
Any cryogenic experiments need to be done in collaboration with BioCAT staff.


Sample preparation laboratory
********************************

BioCAT provides a `well-equipped wet lab <{filename}/pages/about_support.rst#wetlab>`_ a few steps away from Beamline 18ID
with dedicated space and equipment for sample preparation and characterization.
Basic supplies (high-purity water, buffer components, solvents, safety equipment
etc.) are provided along with a full suite of 4 °C refrigerators, -20 °C, -80 °C
freezers, biohazard storage and disposal. One Zeiss Stemi 2000 and two Zeiss SV6
stereo microscopes are available for dissection and sample characterization. For
intact rodent skeletal muscle experiments, there is a bench-top SomnoFlo Low-Flow
Electronic Isoflurane Vaporizer from Kent Scientific Corporation that allows
obtaining multiple muscle samples form a single animal and/or in situ X-ray
diffraction measurements.

There is a recently developed (Spring 2025) staging area (~250 sq ft.) just
outside the experimental enclosure for fiber diffraction experiments that
allows users to perform final sample manipulations before the X-ray diffraction
experiments as well as perform off-line muscle mechanics experiments and
biochemical assays.  These include a Nikon Eclipse TI2-A inverted microscope
with epifluorescence capabilities and digital photo documentation that we
have adapted to do mant-ATP pulse-chase experiments for measurements of myosin
heads in the so-called Super-Relaxed State (SRX) in parallel with mechanical
measurements on myocytes.  The staging area also includes facilities for
mechanical measurements from myocytes and fibers, a dissection station and a
video microscopy station for sarcomere length measurements.
