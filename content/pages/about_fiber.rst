    Many biological fibers such as muscle, hair, and viruses have internal structure
    which can be probed with X-rays. Using this technique, one can study the
    arrangement of proteins in muscle and tendons. It may be used to understand
    human maladies such as heart disease and cancer.

The `design features <{filename}/pages/about_beamline.rst>`_ of the BioCAT
beamline 18ID and the `source properties of the APS <https://ops.aps.anl.gov/SRparameters/SRparameters.html>`_
allow collection of fiber diffraction patterns of exceptional quality
from complex, weakly diffracting biological systems within very short exposure
times. The small focal spots achievable with this instrument (~30 x 150 μm\ :sup:`2`)
have allowed excellent discrimination of fine detail in fiber patterns from
muscle, connective tissue, and filamentous viruses as well as detection of
weak diffraction features in the presence of large backgrounds. The low
divergence of the undulator source and the independent horizontal and vertical
focusing of our optics simultaneously allows small beam spots at the sample
and at the detector that can be varied over a wide range. The high X-ray flux
of this instrument (~2.0 x 10\ :sup:`13` photons/s) permits dynamic experiments on
these systems with a high time-resolution (sub-millisecond).

The available sample-to-detector lengths range from 0.2 to 9 m to cover a
very large range of reciprocal space and the CCD detector has very flexible
binning and streak-camera modes for time-resolved experiments. We are
currently developing micro-diffraction capabilities that will allow examination
of ordered structures in regions as small as 1 x 5 μm\ :sup:`2`. Applications include,
for example, finding small ordered regions in connective tissue for high
resolution studies and mapping amyloid structures in brain tissues that may
be associated with neurodegenerative disease.

Capabilities for X-ray Fiber Crystallography
===============================================

Fiber crystallography experiments use either the focused main beam or the output
of one of our two Compound Refractive Lenses (CRL's). The first of these has a
focal length of 1.8 m and a spot size at the focus of 23 x 4 μm\ :sup:`2` with a flux
of ~2 x 10\ :sup:`12` photons/s. The second CRL has a focal length of 50 cm with a focal
spot of ~ 1 x 5 μm\ :sup:`2` containing ~2 x 10\ :sup:`11` photons/s. The beam focus can be
located at the detector for maximum X-ray pattern data quality, the sample for
maximum spatial resolution or somewhere in between when compromises are necessary.
It also possible to focus the main beam at a slit to give a well collimated 60 x 60 mm\ :sup:`2`
beam, which although is larger than with the micro-diffraction instrument, is still
small enough to find the ordered domains in many samples. The advantage of this
instrument is that it gives us useful and simple setup for near small angle
through to wide angle (1/160 Å\ :sup:`-1` to 1/2 Å\ :sup:`-1`) with a low background and high
signal to noise ratio. Another advantage of this instrument is that it is more
straightforward to change camera lengths from 250 mm to 1 m allowing for ranges
of d spacing from 1/125 – 1/3.5 Å\ :sup:`-1` (shortest camera) and 1/500-1/13 Å\ :sup:`-1`
(longest camera) at 12 keV. The delicate crystallinity of user samples coupled
with the high intensity of the X-ray beam necessitates cryo capabilities. This is
less straightforward then for crystallography beamlines due to the sample sizes
and nature (tissue dissections, preparations, sections). To maintain fibrous
samples at liquid nitrogen temperature we have a custom cold nitrogen stream
system made to our specifications (it lacks the warm shield gas layer used in
conventional crystallography cryo-jets) by Cryo Industries of America. Leica
CPC plunge-freezing station for sample cryo-freezing / manipulation before being
placed in the cryo-jet stream.

Instrumentation for muscle diffraction
================================================

For online muscle mechanics and X-ray measurements we have several horizontal
muscle mechanics rigs that are optimized for either skinned or intact muscle
preparations. Different chamber sizes can be custom fabricated using 3D
printing to accommodate different sizes of muscles. One of these rigs is based
on a design by Dr. Pieter De Tombe (University College London) and is equipped
with a laser diffraction system including a linear CCD sarcomere length computer
system (Dexela Inc., UK) for on line sarcomere length measurement allowing for
feedback control in intact muscle preparations. Other rigs have simpler laser
diffraction arrangements suitable for setting initial sarcomere length in skinned
muscles. For these rigs we have several motors (Aurora Scientific 308B, 315C or
Güth Scientific Instruments linear motor Si-MOTDB) and various force (Güth KG or
Aurora 400 series) transducers for different force levels. For higher throughput
measurements on transgenic mouse cardiac muscle samples, some users prefer to use
small individual sample cells that allow length adjustment with sarcomere length
being monitored by an offline video microscope and image analysis system (Aurora
Scientific model 900B). For whole muscle studies we have 2 Aurora 300B muscle
lever system custom modified for fast step response.  These are used in a vertical
rig designed for whole rodent and frog leg muscles with electrical stimulation
with a high power muscle stimulator (Aurora Scientific 701B). Also available are
fast shutters, capable of 0.5 ms exposures, various storage oscilloscopes for
measuring timing. For remote controlled solution exchange we have four Hamilton
Microlab 500 series dual syringe pumps equipped with multi-way valves. We also
have one Aurora 600A (Linux based) and one Aurora 605 A (windows based) AD/DA
data acquisition and control systems.
