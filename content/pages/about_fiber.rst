    Many biological fibers such as muscle, hair, and viruses have internal structure
    which can be probed with X-rays. Using this technique, one can study the
    arrangement of proteins in muscle and tendons. It may be used to understand
    human maladies such as heart disease and cancer.

The design features of the BioCAT beam-line 18 ID and the unique source properties
of the APS allow collection of fiber diffraction patterns of exceptional quality
from complex, weakly diffracting biological systems within very short exposure
times. The small focal spots achievable with this instrument (~50 x 150 μm2)
have allowed excellent discrimination of fine detail in fiber patterns from
muscle, connective tissue, and filamentous viruses as well as detection of
weak diffraction features in the presence of large backgrounds. The low
divergence of the undulator source and the independent horizontal and vertical
focusing of our optics simultaneously allows small beam spots at the sample
and at the detector that can be varied over a wide range. These beam sizes
are very well matched to the resolution of our high sensitivity CCD detectors.
The high X-ray flux of this instrument (~2.0 x 1013 photons/s) permits dynamic
experiments on these systems with a high time-resolution (sub-milli-second).

The available sample-to-detector lengths range from 0.2 to 5.7 m to cover a
very large range of reciprocal space and the CCD detector has very flexible
binning and streak-camera modes for time-resolved experiments. We are
currently developing micro-diffraction capabilities that will allow examination
of ordered structures in regions as small as 5 x 5 μm2. Applications include,
for example, finding small ordered regions in connective tissue for high
resolution studies and mapping amyloid structures in brain tissues that may
be associated with neurodegenerative disease.

Capabilities for X-ray Fiber Crystallography
===============================================

We now have two mature, high-performance, instruments for fiber crystallography,
one based on the KB mirror micro-focusing optics described above, and the other
based on the collimated main beam. The useful d-space range from the micro-
diffraction instrument is 1/200 – 1/3.4 Å-1 at 12 keV and 1/900-1/20 Å-1 at 8
keV. Beam sizes and divergences for different focal positions are given in
Table 3. The beam can be focused at the detector for maximum X-ray pattern
data quality, the sample for maximum spatial resolution or somewhere in between
when compromises are necessary. The second instrument focuses the main beam at a
slit to give a well collimated 60 x 60 mm beam, which although is larger than
with the micro-diffraction instrument, is still small enough to find the ordered
domains in many samples. The advantage of this instrument is that it gives us
useful and simple setup for near small angle through to wide angle (1/160 Å-1
to 1/2 Å-1) with a low background and high signal to noise ratio. Another
advantage of this instrument is that it is more straightforward to change
camera lengths from 250 mm to 1m allowing for ranges of d spacing from 1/125
– 1/3.5 Å-1 (shortest camera) and 1/500-1/13 Å  (longest camera) at 12 keV.
The delicate crystallinity of user samples coupled with the high intensity
of the X-ray beam necessitates cryo capabilities. This is less straightforward
then for crystallography beamlines due to the sample sizes and nature (tissue
dissections, preparations, sections). To maintain fibrous samples at liquid
nitrogen temperature we have a custom cold nitrogen stream system made to our
specifications (it lacks the warm shield gas layer used in conventional
crystallography cryo-jets) by Cryo Industries of America. Leica CPC plunge-
freezing station for sample cryo-freezing / manipulation before being placed
in the cryo-jet stream.

Instrumentation for muscle diffraction
================================================

For online muscle mechanics and X-ray measurements we have a horizontal muscle
mechanics rig equipped with a laser diffraction system including a linear CCD
sarcomere length computer system (Dexela Inc., UK), motors (Aurora Scientific
308B or Guth Scientific Instruments linear motor Si-MOTDB) and various force
transducers for different force levels, and a high power muscle stimulator
(Aurora Scientific 701B). For higher throughput measurements on transgenic
mouse cardiac muscle samples, many users prefer to use small individual sample
cells that allow length adjustment with sarcomere length being monitored by an
offline video microscope and image analysis system (Aurora Scientific model 900B).
For whole muscle studies we have an Aurora 300B muscle lever system custom modified
for fast step response. Also available are fast shutters, capable of 0.5 ms exposures,
storage oscilloscopes and a National Instruments based A/D, D/A system.
