Fully developed and commissioned detectors for the beamline include a high
sensitivity, high spatial resolution Aviex PCCD1680 (80 x 160mm, 39 µm pixels,
5 ADU/12 keV X-ray photon), and MAR165 CCD (165 mm diameter active area,
standard mode 2k x 2k 80 µm pixels, ~1 ADU/ 12 keV X-ray photon) detectors.
The MAR detector has been upgraded with baseline stabilization electronics
and a thinner phosphor (~65 µm psf function) so it can be used in unbinned
mode with 40 µm pixels. We have two Pilatus 100k pixel array detectors (84 x
33.5 mm active area, 170 µm pixel, photon counting) and a Fuji Bas2500 image
plate scanner. For equilibrium and time resolved macromolecular SAXS we have a
Pilatus 3 1M detector that is 981 x 1043 \, 172 x 172 µm2 pixels for a 170 x
180 mm2 active area, photon-counting detector able to read at 500 fps.
