For many proteins, the ability to change shape is essential for their proper functioning within
cells. One longstanding question concerns the process proteins follow when shifting from
an unfolded to a three-dimensional globular form. Most previous studies have supported the
idea that when an unfolded protein is exposed to native conditions (i.e., to an environment favoring
its typically fully-folded, physiological form) a continuous unfolded-to-semi-folded collapse ensues.
However, other studies suggest that there is an energetic bottleneck to this step that renders
it an all-or-none transition. To resolve the issue, researchers from the University of Massachusetts
Medical School and the Illinois Institute of Technology probed the folding stages of cytochrome c,
an archetype for protein folding behavior. Its microsecond-scale folding dynamics were unambiguously
characterized with Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) complimented by smallangle
x-ray scattering (SAXS) carried out at the APS. The SAXS and FRET measurements refuted
the conventional view that cytochrome c folding proceeds immediately and smoothly when exposed
to native conditions; instead, subpopulations of unfolded and semi-folded protein were observed
to coexist during brief intervals. These results provide fundamental insights for biochemistry,
as well as for human diseases characterized by protein misfolding, including Parkinson’s, Huntington’s,
Alzheimer’s, and lysosomal storage diseases.

            	**Fig. 2.** Kinetic model for cytochrome c folding immediately following denaturant dilution (i.e., to an
				environment favoring compaction). The semi-quantitative reaction coordinate shows the approximate
				free energy (G) and barrier heights for various states of protein folding. The left portion of the
				blue plot indicates the state that dominates at the barrier to the next folding step: well within the first
				30 microseconds (<<30 µs), unfolded state 1 dominates. At ~30 µs, the most numerous protein structure
				is partially-folded state 2. And ~100-µs later, partially-folded state 3 dominates. (Previous
				state-of-the-art measurements, with ~1-msec resolution, lumped states 1, 2, and 3 together as indicated
				by “SF [stopped-flow] burst phase ensemble.”) SAXS measurements give the radius of gyration,
				Rg, for each state. While state 3 was known previously, these experiments filled in knowledge
				of early folding dynamics, i.e., <100 µs. The right portion of the blue plot shows that folding to the
				final, globular structure occurs very quickly (<<650 µs) once the barrier after state 3 is overcome.
				Red and green plots at bottom show two reaction coordinates, Rg and “average FRET efficiency,” illustrating
				the global and pairwise distance changes, respectively

		In the laboratory, protein structure
		can be altered by varying the temperature,
		chemical environment, etc. For instance,
		the shapes of proteins suspended
		in solution can be changed by
		varying the concentration of a chemical
		denaturant. In this study, guanidinium
		hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was used as a
		denaturant to uncoil cytochrome c, a
		small, globular, iron-containing protein
		(hemeprotein). Figure 1a shows its
		globule form, Fig. 1b an unfolded state.

		Cytochrome c molecules were initially
		suspended in a highly-concentrated
		solution of GdnHCl, which relaxed
		some of the protein globules into
		a chain-like (unfolded) form. To start the
		folding process, the protein chains
		were suddenly exposed to a near-native
		state (i.e., to an environment with
		little denaturant) using microfluidics
		techniques that allowed extreme dilution
		of the GdnHCl-concentrated solution
		in just 25-30 µs.

		Previous experiments capable of
		resolving early (<100 µs) folding dynamics
		were unable to differentiate between
		partially-folded and unfolded
		forms mixed together. By contrast, the
		FRET and SAXS techniques were capable
		of detecting the presence of both
		folded and unfolded subpopulations immediately
		following dilution of the
		GdnHCl denaturant.

		FRET employed rapid laser pulses
		to excite the Trp59 chromophore (a molecular
		segment that gives the protein
		its color). Due to their close proximity
		(several nanometers) and similar electronic
		energy levels (the “resonance” in
		FRET), energy could pass from the
		Trp59 to the heme molecule (called the
		“donor” and “acceptor,” respectively).
		This is a quantum mechanical, non-radiative
		process (i.e., no actual photon is
		transferred). Energy accepted by the
		heme molecule in this process was dissipated. However, sometimes the excited
		Trp59 molecule re-emitted the energy
		as a photon, which could then be
		detected by a sensor. The time between
		a laser pulse and Trp59 photon
		emission was measured. Because this
		interval varied according to the Trp59-
		to-heme distance (which indicates protein
		shape) the proportions of any unfolded
		and partially-folded states could
		be calculated.

		The FRET results revealed that following
		denaturant dilution, certain subpopulations
		dominated during particular
		time intervals: within the first 30 µs after
		dilution, the unfolded state (denoted as
		“state 1” for convenience) dominated,
		accompanied by a small proportion of
		partially-folded states. After 30 µs, a
		transition to a partially-folded “state 2”
		occurred, followed still later by dominance
		of partially-folded “state 3.”
		These discrete jumps in subpopulation
		ratios, which occurred as the initiallyunfolded
		protein transitioned to the
		globular form, are referred to as “barrier-limited
		chain collapse.”

		The SAXS experiments, which
		were carried out at the Bio-CAT 18-IDD
		beamline at the APS were performed
		as an independent check on the FRET
		results. SAXS measured a parameter
		called the radius of gyration (Rg). This
		parameter quantified the spatial distribution
		of all of the molecular components
		of cytochrome c, thereby indicating
		the degree of folding. Figure 2
		depicts folding dynamics as measured
		by a combination of the SAXS and
		FRET methods. The top curve in the
		figure gives a sense of the barrier limits
		seen at various stages of the folding
		process. Each phase in the dynamic
		folding process exhibits a particular Rg,
		which in turn indicates a particular
		structural state (a smaller Rg implies
		greater protein compaction).

		The SAXS and FRET results highlight
		the importance of employing techniques
		that can detect subpopulations
		in folding reactions. Moreover, firmly establishing
		the existence of barrier-limited
		protein folding will propel the
		search for the physical source of this
		behavior. *- Philip Koth*
