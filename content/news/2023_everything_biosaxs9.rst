            BioCAT is offering its ninth intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS.
            Students will have four days of virtual lectures and hands-on
            software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS data collection and
            processing from expert practitioners in the field. Students will
            also be able to mail in samples for data collection on the BioCAT
            beamline (Sector 18 at the APS) before the course, and there will
            be time during the workshop to get help with analysis of their own
            data.

            The course will take place from 2/28/23 to 3/3/23 and is entirely
            virtual (via Zoom). See the schedule below for details.

Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All participants this year will be remote participants. The course will provide
a virtual set of lectures and tutorials via Zoom, and participants will be
able to mail in samples for SAXS data collection at BioCAT the week before the
workshop. Participants will be able to ask questions during both lectures and
tutorials, and will have time to get help with analysis of the data collected
from their mail-in samples. They will also receive downloads of all course
materials, including lecture slides and tutorials.

**Note: This course is intended for researchers interested in scattering from
monodisperse biological macromolecules in solution. It is NOT for soft matter,
materials, or systems which are polydisperse.**

Registration will be limited to 30 participants in order to allow for data
collection and one-on-one and/or small-group interactions between participants
and instructors. We will offer 10 participants the opportunity to supply
samples for the workshop. These participants will mail in samples for data
collection on the BioCAT beamline (Sector 18 at the Advanced Photon Source)
before the course. There is no cost associated with the workshop and
registration is on a first-come first-served basis.

How to register

    Registration is CLOSED.


More information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Course topics:

*   Basic principles of SAXS
*   Critical sample preparation and data collection procedures, including
    online size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-SAXS)
*   Evaluating data quality
*   Basic data processing including size (R\ :sub:`g`, D\ :sub:`max`), molecular
    weight, the P(r) function, and real space reconstructions
*   What you need to know for publication
*   Overview of several advanced and emerging methods
*   Hands-on tutorials with data processing software

While the primary purpose of the course is educational, participants may
mail-in a limited number (1-2) of their own research samples for data
collection the week before the course.

While BioCAT supports SEC-SAXS, SEC-MALS-SAXS, and batch mode SAXS, due to
time constraints students will be limited to only SEC-SAXS data collection.
Please read our guide on `how to design a SAXS experiment <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_design.rst>`_
and `how to prepare your SAXS samples <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_prepare.rst>`_.

If you have questions, please contact Jesse Hopkins (jhopkins1@iit.edu).

Confirmed speakers:

*   Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT, APS)
*   Max Watkins (BioCAT, APS)
*   Richard Gillilan (MacCHESS, CHESS)
*   Thomas Grant (U. Buffalo)
*   Kushol Gupta (U. Pennsylvania)
*   Steve Meisburger (Cornell U.)
*   Tanja Mittag (St. Jude)
