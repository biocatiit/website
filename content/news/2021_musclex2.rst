            BioCAT is offering its second MuscleX workshop. The Biophysics
            Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT) is funded by National Institutes
            of Health (NIH) with its mission to operate state-of-the-art x-ray
            facilities for the study of the structure and dynamics of biological
            systems under non-crystalline conditions similar to their functional
            states in living tissues. We will have a series of introductory
            presentations of the scientific missions supported at BioCAT as
            well as a series of talks highlighting recent muscle studies using
            x-ray diffraction and scattering.

            The workshop will take place from 5/20/21 to 5/21/21 and is
            entirely virtual (via BlueJeans). See the schedule below for
            details.
