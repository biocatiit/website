After the left ventricle of the heart contracts, it must relax efficiently to
prepare to refill and supply the body with blood on the next beat.  An
increasing number of patients — including nearly all patients with heart
failure — suffer from impaired relaxation, which is part of a clinical syndrome
known as diastolic dysfunction. Currently, treatments for impaired relaxation
do not exist.

A team of Wayne State University School of Medicine researchers led by Charles
Chung, Ph.D., assistant professor of physiology, recently received a $1,894,271
grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National
Institutes of Health to address the critical need for new drug targets and
diagnostic indexes for diastolic dysfunction using novel biomechanical tests
that ultimately can be translated into clinical practice.

According to Chung, the project was inspired by his research team’s finding
that how quickly the heart’s muscle moves is directly related to how fast the
muscle can relax. The project will use unique experiments and imaging
techniques to link mechanical properties of the heart with models of heart
failure that occur in patients.

“My lab’s main research focus is to understand how the heart muscle moves at
the end of contraction and how this motion can speed up the force decline, or
relaxation, of the muscle,” said Chung. “Major proteins in muscles called myosin,
actin and titin control the force of each beat. When the heart muscle contracts,
myosin binds to actin to generate force. Our lab is trying to determine if
motion — and how fast the motion occurs — makes myosin let go of actin faster
and make the muscle relax faster.”

Myosin can also be affected by other proteins like titin, which is not only
the largest naturally occurring protein, but which acts like a spring or rubber
band within the muscle. Using titin with different stiffness levels means the
team can determine if a “stiff spring” will enhance how the muscle responds (
i.e. how myosin will detach) when it is moved.

To “see” what these proteins are doing when a muscle moves, the Wayne State
team is collaborating with investigators from BioCAT. The combined expertise
of BioCAT and Chung’s lab will allow the team will use x-ray diffraction to
study how myosin changes position when living and beating heart muscles move.

Chung’s studies of proteins within the heart muscle might also help patients
with diastolic dysfunction.

“We’re working with collaborators in the Department of Internal Medicine at
Wayne State including Luis Afonso, M.D., chief of cardiology, and Noreen
Rossi, M.D., professor in the Division of Nephrology and a researcher at
the VA,” said Chung. “Our work will look at how western diet staples like
fructose and salt can change the movement of the heart and hinder relaxation.
We’re also studying how our laboratory studies might translate to the clinics,
where Afonso and Rossi regularly see patients suffering from diastolic
dysfunction.”
