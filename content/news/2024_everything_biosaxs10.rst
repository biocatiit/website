            BioCAT is offering its tenth intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS.
            Students will have four days of virtual lectures and hands-on
            software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS data collection and
            processing from expert practitioners in the field. Students may
            also be able to mail in samples for data collection on the BioCAT
            beamline (Sector 18 at the APS) before the course, and there will
            be time during the workshop to get help with analysis of their own
            data.

            The course will take place from 12/10/24 to 12/13/24 and is entirely
            virtual (via Zoom). See the schedule below for details.

Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All participants this year will be remote participants. The course will provide
a virtual set of lectures and tutorials via Zoom. Participants will be able to
ask questions during both lectures and tutorials, and will have time to get
help with analysis of their own data. They will also receive downloads of
all course materials, including lecture slides and tutorials.

**Note: This course is intended for researchers interested in scattering from
monodisperse biological macromolecules in solution. It is NOT for soft matter,
materials, or systems which are polydisperse.**

Depending on facility availability, a limited number of participants may be
able to mail in samples for SAXS data collection at BioCAT the week before the
workshop. This availability will be determined closer to the start of the workshop.

Registration will be limited to 30 participants in order to allow for data
collection and one-on-one and/or small-group interactions between participants
and instructors. There is no cost associated with the workshop and
registration will be granted upon review of a short application.

How to apply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To apply for a spot in the workshop fill out the short application. This requests
basic contact and demographic data as well as your experience with SAXS and
a paragraph about your research interests and proposed use of SAXS

Applications will be accepted through September 30th 2024, and reviewed the
week of October 1st. You will be notified by email about your application.

The application is available here:
`https://forms.office.com/r/t07jQ3rp0X <https://forms.office.com/r/t07jQ3rp0X>`_
