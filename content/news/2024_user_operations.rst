Starting with the APS 2025-1 run next year BioCAT will be resuming user
operations. After the long dark period for the APS upgrade (APS-U) project,
we are very excited to be welcoming you back to the facility early next
year. If you are interested in beam time next run, `please contact the
appropriate beamline scientist: Dr. Weikang Ma for muscle/fiber diffraction
and either of Drs. Max Watkins and Jesse Hopkins for solution SAXS. <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_

We also invite you to join us on January 10th at 1 pm CST for a virtual Town
Hall where we will discuss the upgrade's effects on BioCAT, new capabilities
that we've added during the dark period, and remind you about the process for
getting beamtime at BioCAT. The tentative schedule is:
