BioCAT hosted its 4th MuscleX Symposium from May 15–16, 2025. BioCAT scientist
Weikang Ma opened the symposium with an introductory presentation on the
scientific missions supported at BioCAT, followed by a historical overview
of BioCAT presented by BioCAT PI Tom Irving. The symposium featured 10 scientific
presentations highlighting recent muscle studies using X-ray diffraction and
other structural techniques. Of the 10 presentations, 6 were given by early-stage
scientists and graduate students—underscoring a strong commitment to supporting
the next generation of muscle researchers. With over 100 registered attendees
and approximately 70 participants present live, the symposium fostered vibrant
discussions, collaboration, and cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange.
