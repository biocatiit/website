Starting April 17, 2023 the APS will be down for a year to undergo a major
upgrade, including rebuilding the accelerator and storage ring (“APS-U”).
Following this upgrade, APS operations will restart in April 2024, though it
may be several more months before all the beamlines are running again. Once
completed, the new APS-U ring will provide about 100 times greater brightness
than is currently available. This will provide both an increase in flux and a
reduced focus size for the APS ID beamlines, including BioCAT.

BioCAT invites you to join us for a virtual town hall on March 15th to discuss
the impact of APS-U on BioCAT and our user community. The purpose of this town
hall is to provide an overview of the planned upgrade and its impact on, and
benefits for, the BioCAT community. We also will present our plans to facilitate
experiments for our users at other synchrotrons during the dark period. The
town hall will consist of short presentations by BioCAT staff followed by an
open-ended question and answer period. No registration is required.


Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The presentations from the town hall and more information about APS-U and
BioCAT can be found on the `APS-U and BioCAT page <{filename}/pages/users_aps_u.rst>`_
