The BioCAT team, led by Prof. Thomas Irving (Illinois Institute of Technology)
has been awarded $2 million in supplementary funds from the National
Institutes of Health to upgrade the BioCAT beamline. These
funds will let us upgrade our x-ray optics (mostly original to
the beamline and more than 20 years old) to modern state-of-the-art
systems that can take full advantage of the new upgraded APS source.
These new optics will provide smaller, more intense x-ray beams
and improved beam stability.

This project will replace the focusing optics with
new KB-style horizontal and vertical focusing mirrors and the monochromator
with a new system with both silicon and multilayer optics to provide both
energy resolution and high flux. The upgrade is expected to take ~2 years
to complete and user operations will continue unhindered while it is taking place.
