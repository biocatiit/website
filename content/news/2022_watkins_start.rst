We are pleased to announce that Dr. Maxwell (Max) Watkins has recently joined 
BioCAT as a beamline scientist. Max got his B.S. degree in Biochemistry from
Lehigh University, and his Ph.D in Chemistry from Princeton University. Much 
of his Ph.D. work was done at Cornell University after Prof. Nozomi Ando, his 
Ph.D. supervisor, moved her lab from Princeton to Cornell. His Ph.D. work 
involved extensive SAXS and cryo-EM studies of flexible systems. During his 
studies he has acquired a strong background in biochemistry and structural 
biology. He is extremely experienced in standard SAXS data collection and 
analysis techniques, including SEC-SAXS, and has used SAXS to study challenging 
light sensitive and anaerobic systems. Max is a great addition to the BioCAT 
team, and will eventually take over running most of the standard SAXS program 
at BioCAT. He will also be a regular participant in our SAXS coffee hours, 
so please drop by and say hi when you have the chance. You can find Max's
contact info `on our Contact page. <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_

Max replaces Dr. Srinivas Chakravarthy, who left BioCAT for exciting
new opportunities in industry in August 2021. We are deeply appreciative of
all the work that Srinivas did over his 9+ years at BioCAT, and wish him all
the best in his new endeavors.
