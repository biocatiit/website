    We are a pleased to announce the delivery and initial commissioning (November
    16 2021) of our new $1.8M, Dectris EIGER2 XE 9M pixel array detector which replaces
    our Pilatus3 X 1M detector after 7 years of reliable service. This
    state-of-the-art detector has dead-time free readout and a larger active
    area (233 x 245 mm\ :sup:`2` vs. 169 x 180 mm\ :sup:`2`), much smaller
    pixels (75 μm vs. 172 μm) and faster frame rate (550 Hz vs 500 Hz) than
    the Pilatus detector. The larger area of the EIGER2 will extend the maximum
    q in macromolecular SAXS experiments in the standard configuration from
    ~0.35 Å\ :sup:`-1` to ~0.50 Å\ :sup:`-1`.  More excitingly, the combination
    of large active area and high spatial resolution of the EIGER2 detector
    will allow using one 3 m camera length for the majority of muscle
    diffraction experiments providing resolution of fine details on the
    meridian at low angles as well as recording the important 2.7 nm actin and 2.8 nm
    myosin meridional reflections at the same time. This will significantly increase
    the information content of our experiments, improve efficiency by minimizing
    need to change camera lengths and raise overall productivity. The lack of
    dead time between frames will allow use of essentially all the photons in fast
    framing time-resolved experiments. These new capabilities have been demonstrated
    in three muscle diffraction experiments with outside users so far.

    The faster frame rate and much increased pixel density have greatly increased
    data transfer, storage, and processing requirements. To handle these high data
    rates we have procured a dedicated, Dell PowerEdge R940xa processing
    server with 36 cores (3.1 GHz), 1.2 TB RAM, 6 TB local storage, 25 GbE,  and a
    NVIDIA Tesla V100s 32G GPU. This will allow for real time data reduction in even
    the fastest SAXS experiments, and rapid on-line data analysis for both SAXS and
    muscle diffraction. We are also in the process of upgrading and expanding our
    network attached storage (NAS) to accommodate the significantly increased data
    volume from this detector.

    We are excited about these new capabilities that should provide reliable
    operations and high performance for many years to come.
