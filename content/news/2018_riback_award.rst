A University of Chicago graduate student in Biophysical Sciences has received
the 2018 Rosalind Franklin Investigator Award from the Advanced Photon Source
\(APS) Users Organization at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne
National Laboratory.

Joshua Riback, who is in his fifth year of graduate studies, was recognized
for his work using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques at the APS
to study biophysical interactions.

Riback’s research focuses on the link between the biophysical properties of
macromolecules and the principles of biological phenomena, such as subcellular
localization and compartmentalization, evolution and fitness. By focusing on
how proteins respond when temperature increases, Riback is working toward
understanding the breadth of mechanisms that occur in the temperature-dependence
and specificity of protein assembly.

“I was quite amazed at the work being done at the synchrotron, especially how
many different techniques by many different fields seem to be taking part at
the same time.” — Joshua Riback, University of Chicago graduate student
and APS user

Ultimately, the goal is to extrapolate these mechanisms to other biological
signals or stresses, so as to develop our understanding of the physical basis
and cellular benefits of assembly.

Riback first worked on a light source during his first year as a graduate
student, an experience that opened his eyes to how the tool can be applied
by so many different scientific disciplines. A synchrotron produces very
powerful, bright X-rays that can probe matter up to the atomic level. Up to
60 different experiments can be done at the same time at the APS, a DOE Office
of Science User Facility.

“I was quite amazed at the work being done at the synchrotron, especially how
many different techniques by many different fields seem to be taking part at
the same time,” he said.

Riback’s research has so far resulted in two ground-breaking papers that
utilized and advanced the application of SAXS, using the BioCAT beamline at
the APS. The first is “Stress-triggered phase separation is an adaptive,
evolutionarily tuned response.” In it, Riback and the team demonstrated the
reconstitution of a physiologically relevant phase separation process in vitro
under physiological conditions, a first. Using SAXS at the APS, his results
connected the unusual biophysical properties of a specific molecule to the
cell’s capacity to grow during stress, a major advance for the field.

The second paper, published in Science, “Innovative scattering analysis shows
that hydrophobic disordered proteins are expanded in water,” developed a new
method to extract the dimensions of disordered proteins and the strength of
intra-protein interactions from a single SAXS measurement. The information
contained within SAXS experiments is often difficult to extract. This is
especially true for polymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins
\(IDPs), where data are fit with analytical functions assuming a Gaussian
random walk developed decades ago. But by using the advantages provided by
the APS (namely, elimination of aggregates and improper subtraction and high
signal to noise as a result of the high intensity of the APS) — coupled with
advances in computation — Riback and team developed a molecular form factor
to quantify the properties of polymers including size and shape.

APS officials said Riback’s analysis procedure resolves the challenge of how
to accurately extract gyration and solvent quality for disordered proteins
and polymers. The application of Riback’s new analysis to a set of three IDPs
challenged the widely held view that the unfolded states of proteins are collapsed
globules under physiological conditions. Although these three IDPs have low-net
charge and hydrophobicity typical of well-folded proteins, each is highly
expanded in the absence of denaturant.

The combination of Riback’s high-data quality, obtained using the state of the art
SEC-SAXS setup at BioCAT, and new analysis procedure were
so strong that his publication was accepted by Science on the first submission,
and Riback’s SAXS analysis method already is becoming the standard in the field.

Riback received his bachelor’s degree in Biophysics from The Johns Hopkins
University. His thesis work is under the dual mentorship of Allan Drummond and
Tobin Sosnick. A native of Livingston, N.J., he will soon become a postdoctoral
researcher at the Brangwynne lab at Princeton University.
