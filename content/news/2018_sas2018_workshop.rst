            Dr. Jesse Hopkins of BioCAT was a co-organizer of the BioSAS
            Advanced Analysis Workshop workshop at the XVII International Small Angle
            Scattering Conference (SAS2018). The workshop focused on advanced
            techniques for analyzing biological scattering data from three different
            software packages: BioXTAS RAW, US-SOMO, and SASSIE-web. Twenty three
            participants from around the world joined six expert instructors for
            the one-day workshop on October 6th 2018.

                Participants and instructors at the SAS2018 BioSAS Advanced
                Analysis Workshop.


Solution small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering methods are having an
increasing impact in structural biology largely due to advanced hardware,
data analysis and modeling. The objective of this workshop was to give users
hands-on practical experience with a variety of software tools that provide
powerful capabilities for processing, analyzing and modeling BioSAS experimental
data. This workshop introduced participants to advanced analysis techniques
including deconvolving SEC-SAS data sets and utilizing molecular dynamics in
combination with SAS curve fitting. The software used was the
BioXTAS RAW, SASSIE-web and US-SOMO software suites. The instructors were
Emre Brookes (UTHSCSA), Joseph Curtis (NIST), Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT, APS),
Richard Gillilan (MacCHESS), Susan Krueger (NIST), Mattia Rocco (HSanMartino, Italy)
and other available staff. Participants were given a mixture of lectures and
hands-on exercises to familiarize themselves with both the software and the
concepts behind the software.

        Dr. Gillilan provides an introduction to RAW

The day started with Dr. Hopkins and Dr. Gillilan providing an overview
evolving factor analysis (EFA) for deconvolution of SEC-SAXS data, and generating
electron density from SAS scattering profiles (DENSS). A brief guided introduction to
BioXTAS RAW was provided to the participants, and then participants followed a
hands-on tutorial document that led them through using EFA and DENSS in RAW,
with help from both instructors.

After a break for lunch, Dr. Brooke and Dr. Rocco provided a guided tutorial in
using US-SOMO to analyze and deconvolve SEC-SAXS data using a Gaussian peak fitting
method. Then Dr. Krueger and Dr. Curtis provided a guided tutorial in how to use
the online SASSIE-Web tools to generate ensembles of structures by MD and fit
these ensembles against SAXS data.
