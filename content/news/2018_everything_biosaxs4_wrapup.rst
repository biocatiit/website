            BioCAT held its fourth intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS from
            11/5/18-11/7/18. The 11 participants received a day and a half of
            lectures and hands-on software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS
            data collection and processing from expert practitioners in the
            field. This was followed by data collection on the BioCAT beamline
            and data  analysis help. Many students brought research samples
            for the data collection portion of the workshop.

BioCAT held it's fourth annual BioSAXS training course from 11/5/18-11/7/18.
There were 11 participants and 6 instructors. Day one started off with breakfast,
followed by an excellent overview of the basic physics of SAXS and what kind
of information you can obtain from the technique by Dr. Xiaobing Zuo (12ID, APS).
This was followed by two talks from Dr. Lokesh Gakhar (Iowa State) going over the
extremely important and sometimes overlooked steps of how to actually plan and
perform SAXS experiments. He covered everything from planning what data you want
to collect to sample preparation for the experiment, to recommended notes you should
take while at the beamline. Following that Dr. Srinivas Chakravarthy (BioCAT)
gave a short talk about how to get beamtime at BioCAT.

After a short break, Dr. Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT) gave a set of lectures, broken up
by lunch, covering the details on what a scattering profile is, basic SAXS data
analysis and validation, and advanced SAXS data analysis. This covered everything
from getting an Rg to doing SEC-SAXS deconvolution and making envelopes. He finished
by giving a talk about best practices for publishing SAXS data.

The rest of the afternoon of day 1 was devoted to illustrating advanced topics,
to give students and idea of how SAXS can address challenging research questions.
Dr. Chakravarthy gave a pair of talks, the first discussing time resolved SAXS
and how and what you can do with the technique at BioCAT. The second focused on
using SAXS data to extract information on mixtures and complexes. There was an
excellent talk by Dr. Wei-Jen Tang (University of Chicago) on his use of
equilibrium and time resolved SAXS as complementary to cryoEM and
crystallography to study human insulin degrading enzyme. The day finished with
a talk from Dr. Tobin Sosnick (University of Chicago) on how to use SAXS to study
flexible systems, with a particular focus on his study of intrinsically disordered proteins.

Day two started off with a brief introduction to BioXTAS RAW, the data processing software
used at the BioCAT beamline (and developed and maintained in-house). Then students
spent the rest of the day working through detailed self-guided tutorials that
took them from basic SAXS data processing and validation through three dimensional
reconstructions. In the afternoon, students started data collection using the
SEC-SAXS instrumentation at the BioCAT beamline.

Day three was focused on data collection at the beamline, with the rest of the students
having a chance to run either their own samples or standards that BioCAT scientists
had prepared for them. There was also help provided for data analysis of
their first SAXS experiments.
