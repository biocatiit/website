            BioCAT held its fifth intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS from
            11/5/19-11/7/19 with 13 on-site participants and 24 remote
            participants. There was a day and a half of lectures and
            hands-on software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS
            data collection and processing from expert practitioners in the
            field. This was followed by data collection on the BioCAT beamline
            and data analysis help for on-site participants. Many students
            brought research samples for the data collection portion of the workshop.

BioCAT held it's fifth annual BioSAXS training course from 11/5/19-11/7/19.
There were 13 on-site participants, 24 remote participants, and 6 instructors.
Day one started off with an excellent overview of the basic physics of SAXS and what kind
of information you can obtain from the technique by Dr. Xiaobing Zuo (12ID, APS).
This was followed by a talk from Dr. Kushol Gupta (Penn. State) going over the
extremely important and sometimes overlooked steps of how to actually plan and
perform SAXS experiments. He covered everything from planning what data you want
to collect to sample preparation for the experiment, to complementary biophysical
techniques for verifying your results. Following that Dr. Srinivas Chakravarthy (BioCAT)
gave a short talk about how to get beamtime at BioCAT.

After a short break, Dr. Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT) gave a lecture covering the
details on what a scattering profile is and basic SAXS data analysis and validation.
Dr. Gupta followed this after lunch with a talk about advanced SAXS data analysis.
This series of talks covered everything from getting an Rg to doing SEC-SAXS
deconvolution and making envelopes. Dr. Hopkins finished by giving a talk about
best practices for publishing SAXS data.

The rest of the afternoon of day 1 was devoted to illustrating advanced topics,
to give students and idea of how SAXS can address challenging research questions.
Dr. Chakravarthy gave talk discussing time resolved SAXS
and how and what you can do with the technique at BioCAT. There was an
excellent talk by Dr. Todd Washington (U. Iowa) on his use of
all atom brownian dynamics coupled to SAXS data to study flexible systems in solution.
The day finished with a talk by Dr. Gupta on atomistic modelign of large assemblies.


Day two started off with a brief introduction to BioXTAS RAW, the data processing software
used at the BioCAT beamline (and developed and maintained in-house). Then students
spent the rest of the day working through detailed self-guided tutorials that
took them from basic SAXS data processing and validation through three dimensional
reconstructions. There was a brief interlude where Dr. Tobin Sosnick (U. Chicago)
gave a talk on how to use SAXS to study flexible systems, with a particular
focus on his study of intrinsically disordered proteins. In the afternoon, students
started data collection using the SEC-SAXS instrumentation at the BioCAT beamline.

Day three was focused on data collection at the beamline, with the rest of the students
having a chance to run either their own samples or standards that BioCAT scientists
had prepared for them. There was also help provided for data analysis of
their first SAXS experiments.
