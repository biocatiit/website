                Dr. Srinivas Chakravarthy, BioCAT beamline scientist, prepares a
                SEC-MALS-SAXS experiment on RNA elements from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

        Small-angle solution x-ray scattering and biochemical characterization studies
        at the BioCAT are being used to study the structure of portions of RNA from the
        SARS-CoV-2 virus. This RNA contains the genetic instructions the virus uses to
        replicate itself.  These experiments are de-signed to see how these structures
        change when they interact with selected small molecules that are potential drug
        candidates. This work is a collaboration between Blanton Tolbert (Department of
        Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University), Amanda Hargrove (Duke University),
        Srinivas Chakravarthy (Illinois Institute of Technology, pictured above) and
        a NMR consortium coordinated by Harald Schwalbe at the Goethe University (Germany).
