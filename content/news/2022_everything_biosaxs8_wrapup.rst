            BioCAT held its eight intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS from
            6/21/22-6/24/22 with 36 remote participants. There were four
            days of lectures and hands-on software tutorials on the basics of
            BioSAXS data collection and processing from expert practitioners
            in the field. Participants could elect to mail in samples for data
            collection prior to the course, and roughly half of them sent
            research samples and were able to analyze their own data as part
            of the workshop.

                BioSAXS 8 Workshop.


BioCAT held its eighth BioSAXS training course from 6/21/22-6/24/22.
There were 36 remote participants and 8 instructors. The workshop was held
entirely online, via Zoom, for ~5 hours each day. Before the workshop
started, participants were able to mail samples to BioCAT for SAXS data collection.
This data was then sent to them, and they were able to analyze it as part of the
workshop.

Day one started off with an excellent overview of the basic physics of SAXS
and what kind of information you can obtain from the technique by Dr.
Richard Gillilan (BioSAXS beamline, CHESS). This was followed by a talk
from Dr. Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT) on the basics of SAXS instrumentation and different
types of SAXS experiments. Dr. Max Watkins (BioCAT) then discussed the
extremely important and sometimes overlooked steps of how to actually plan
and perform SAXS experiments. He covered everything from planning what data
you want to collect to sample preparation for the experiment, to complementary
biophysical techniques for verifying your results. Following that Dr. Hopkins
gave a lecture covering the details on what a scattering profile is
and basic SAXS data analysis and validation. The first day ended with a Q&A
with Drs. Gillilan, Hopkins, and Watkins and the participants.

Day two started with an overview of SAXS data processing software by Dr. Hopkins.
Then the workshop broke into smaller groups, and students spent several hours
working through detailed self-guided tutorials that took them through basic SAXS
data processing and validation. Each small group had an expert available to answer
any questions that came up. Participants then returned to the large group, and
Dr. Steve Meisburger (Cornell U.) gave a talk on SEC-SAXS, describing what it is,
why it's useful, how to analyze the data, common issues, and some advanced
analysis methods. The rest of the day was spent in the small groups working
on a tutorial covering SEC-SAXS data analysis.

Day three started with a talk by Dr. Tom Grant (U. Buffalo) about calculating theoretical SAXS
profiles from models and reconstructing 3D models from SAXS data. Dr. Watkins
then gave a talk on best practices for publishing SAXS data. This was followed
by a talk from Dr. Hopkins on time resolved SAXS and how and what you can
do with the technique at BioCAT. Dr. Erik Martin (DewpointX) then gave a talk
highlighting his recent work using TR-SAXS to study liquid liquid phase transitions.
The rest of the day was spent in small groups
doing a tutorial on 3D reconstructions and calculating theoretical SAXS profiles
from models.

Day four started with a series of lectures on advanced applications and analysis
of SAXS data. Dr. Watkins started with a lecture introducing the principles
and practice of rigid body modeling with SAXS data. Dr. Hopkins gave a talk
about analyzing flexible and disordered systems using SAXS, with a particular
focus on ensemble analysis methods. Dr. Tobin Sosnick (U. Chicago) gave a talk on
using SAXS to analyze intrinsically disordered proteins. Finally, Dr. Jeff
Wereszczynski (Illinois Institute of Technology) gave a talk on how to couple
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to SAXS data. There was then
a small group session focusing on data analysis of the SAXS data
collected on the samples they sent as part of the workshop. The workshop
finished with a brief lecture from Dr. Hopkins on the practical steps
to apply for beamtime at BioCAT, and a large group Q&A with Drs. Hopkins
and Watkins.
