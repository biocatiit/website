            We are pleased to announce the fourth BioCAT MuscleX symposium.
            The Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT), funded by the
            National Institutes of Health (NIH), operates state-of-the-art X-ray
            facilities for studying the structure and dynamics of biological
            systems under non-crystalline conditions, resembling their functional
            states in living tissues. The symposium will feature an introductory
            presentation on BioCAT's scientific missions, new capabilities enabled
            by recent upgrades to the APS source and to the BioCAT beamline, and
            a series of talks highlighting recent muscle studies utilizing X-ray
            diffraction or other structural techniques.

            The workshop will take place from 5/15/2025 to 5/16/2025 and will
            be entirely virtual (via Zoom https://iit-edu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tup-TPN-RS2g_pqBKHSQ5w).
