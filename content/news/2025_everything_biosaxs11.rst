            BioCAT is offering its eleventh intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS.
            Students will have four days of virtual lectures and hands-on
            software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS data collection and
            processing from expert practitioners in the field. Students will
            also be able to come on site or mail in samples for data collection
            on the BioCAT beamline (Sector 18 at the APS) after the lecture
            portion of the course.

            The lectures will take place from 10/7/25 to 10/10/25 and are entirely
            virtual (via Zoom). Data collection will occur the week of 10/23/25.
            See the schedule below for details.

Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The course will provide a virtual set of lectures and tutorials via Zoom.
Participants will be able to ask questions during both lectures and tutorials,
and will have time to get help with analysis of their own data. They will also
receive downloads of all course materials, including lecture slides and tutorials.

**Note: This course is intended for researchers interested in scattering from
monodisperse biological macromolecules in solution. It is NOT for soft matter,
materials, or systems which are polydisperse.**

Participants are also invited to come on-site or mail in samples for data
collection and  training. Data collection will occur during the week of 10/23/25.

There is no cost associated with the workshop (excepting travel and lodging costs
for participants who come on site for data collection, which individual participants
must cover) and registration will be granted upon review of a short application.

How to apply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To apply for a spot in the workshop fill out the short application. This requests
basic contact and demographic data as well as your experience with SAXS and
a paragraph about your research interests and proposed use of SAXS
