A team of researchers led by Prof. Thomas Irving (Illinois Institute of
Technology) has received a $8.6 million grant from the National Institutes
of Health to continue to operate the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team
(BioCAT) facility at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory
for the next 5 years. The facility provides access to the most intense X-ray
beams in the Western Hemisphere for the study of non-crystalline biological
materials such as muscle, connective tissue, amyloids, viruses, proteins, and
other large biological molecules and their complexes, in order to understand
the structural underpinnings of human maladies such as heart disease, cancer,
and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Several COVID 19
projects have been hosted since the pandemic began. The other members of the
scientific staff at BioCAT who co-wrote the proposal are beamline scientists
Weikang Ma, Srinivas Chakravarthy and Jesse Hopkins.

The new grant is a NIGMS P30 grant for Mature Synchrotron Resources, and allows
BioCAT to focus on our core mission of providing cutting edge facilities
and experimental capabilities for our users. Among other highlights, the
grant will provide a new state of the art x-ray detector (Dectris EIGER 2 XE
9M), which has a larger area, smaller pixels, and faster readout than our
current detector, and will greatly enhance both solution and muscle/fiber
scattering experiments.
