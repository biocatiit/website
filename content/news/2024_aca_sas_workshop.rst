            BioCAT is helping organize an introductory small angle scattering
            workshop at the 2024 ACA Annual Meeting in Denver CO.
            The workshop will introduce both the theory of the method and best
            practices common to the field and will include lectures and a
            selection of hands-on practical exercises from leading experts
            in the field.

            The course will take place on July 7th, 2024.

Workshop: Applications of Small Angle Scattering to Structural Biology: An Introduction

Small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS, or SAS) has experienced
dramatic growth over the past fifteen years within the structural biology
community, emerging as an important and versatile analytical technique for the
study of the structure and function of biological macromolecules in solution.
This workshop at the 2024 ACA annual meeting in Denver CO will introduce both
the theory of the method and best practices common to the field and will
include lectures and a selection of hands-on practical exercises. Throughout
the workshop the emphasis will be on practical application: knowing how to
judge data quality, how to troubleshoot during data collection, and the
expectations for a successful experiment and acceptable publication. Students
will also learn about aspects of home laboratory data collection and important
complementary biophysical techniques for validating your SAS data.

Course topics include:

*   Basic principles of SAS
*   Critical sample preparation and data collection procedures, including SEC-SAXS
*   Basic data processing including size (Rg, Dmax), molecular weight, the P(r) function, and real space reconstructions
*   Overview of ensemble and atomistic modeling
*   Evaluating data quality and hands-on tutorials with data processing software
*   What you need to know for publication

Confirmed speakers:

*   Thomas Grant (U. Buffalo)
*   Kushol Gupta (U. Pennsylvania)
*   Michal Hammel (ALS)
*   Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT, APS)
*   Greg Hura (ALS)
*   Andreas Keilbach (Anton Paar)
*   Steve Meisburger (Cornell U.)
*   Sai Venkatesh Pingali (ORNL)
*   Thomas Weiss (SSRL)


The workshop is sponsored in part by:

*   Anton Paar
*   Waters/Wyatt
*   Rigaku
*   SAXS Consulting
*   Xenocs
