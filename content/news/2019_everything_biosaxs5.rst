            BioCAT is offering its fifth intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS.
            Students will have a day and a half of lectures and hands-on
            software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS data collection and
            processing from expert practitioners in the field. This will be
            followed by data collection on the BioCAT beamline (Sector 18
            at the APS) and data analysis help. Students are encouraged to bring
            1-2 research samples for the data collection.

            The course will take place from 11/5/19-11/7/19 at the APS (see
            schedule below for details).

            For the first time ever, BioCAT is offering this course for
            remote participants. Remote participants will get a live-streamed
            feed of the lectures and all of the tutorial materials. They will
            not be able to collect data.

How to register
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. lead::

    Registration is CLOSED.

On-site registration is first come, first served, and limited to the first 15 participants
due to time constraints on how many users can collect data during the course.

Remote registration is available to everyone.

Cost
^^^^^^

On-site: $150/$300 for academic/industrial
Remote: $50/$100 for academic/industrial

Lodging and Travel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Participants are responsible for their own lodging and travel. We recommend
participants plan to arrive Monday (11/4) and leave Friday morning (11/8).
Rooms are available at the `Argonne Guest House <https://www.anlgh.org/>`_.

More information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the primary purpose of the course is educational, students may bring a
limited number (1-2) of their own research samples. Prepared standard protein
samples will be available to all students for training purposes.

Course topics:

*   Basic principles of SAXS
*   Critical sample preparation and data collection procedures, including
    online size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-SAXS)
*   Evaluating data quality
*   Basic data processing including size (R\ :sub:`g`, D\ :sub:`max`), molecular weight, the P(r)
    function, and real space reconstructions
*   What you need to know for publication
*   Overview of several advanced and emerging methods
*   Hands-on tutorials with data processing software

Students will be assigned into small groups for 4 hour data collection slots
starting Wednesday afternoon and running through Thursday evening (11 pm). If
you are coming as a group or if you need a particular time slot, please notify
Jesse Hopkins (jhopkins1@iit.edu) for scheduling. Lectures and tutorials are
finished by 6 pm on Tuesday. Data analysis help is available in parallel with 
the data collection on Wednesday, but it is not a formal tutorial.

While BioCAT supports SEC-SAXS, SEC-MALS-SAXS, and batch mode SAXS, due to
time constraints students will be limited to only SEC-SAXS data collection. 
Please contact Srinivas
Chakravarthy (schakrav11@gmail.com) with any questions about samples or sample
preparation.

Speakers:

*   Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT, APS)
*   Srinivas Chakravarthy (BioCAT, APS)
*   Xiaobing Zuo (Sector 12, APS)
*   Tobin Sosnick (U. Chicago)
*   Kushol Gupta (U. Pennsylvania)
