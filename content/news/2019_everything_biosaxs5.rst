            BioCAT is offering its fifth intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS.
            Students will have two days of lectures and hands-on
            software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS data collection and
            processing from expert practitioners in the field. This will be
            followed by data collection on the BioCAT beamline (Sector 18
            at the APS) and data analysis help. Students are encouraged to bring
            1-2 research samples for the data collection.

            The course will take place from 11/5/19-11/7/19 at the APS (see
            schedule below for details).

            For the first time ever, BioCAT is offering this course for
            remote participants. Remote participants will get a live-streamed
            feed of the lectures and all of the tutorial materials. They will
            not be able to collect data.

Registration types and cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BioCAT is offering two methods of participation for this workshop. The first is on-site,
the second is remote.

On-site
--------

The on-site participant registration includes the lectures, hands-on training,
and data collection. Lunch and coffee breaks are provided.
Due to time constraints on data collection we can only accept 15 on-site
participants.

On-site cost: $150/$300 for academic/industrial

Remote
---------

Remote participant registration provides live-streams of all the lectures and downloads of all
course materials, including lecture slides and tutorials. The tutorials are designed
to be self-guided and so can be completed by the remote participants, but there
is no live-stream of that portion. No data collection is associated with remote
participation.

Remote cost: $50/$100 for academic/industrial

How to register
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. lead::

    Registration is OPEN for remote participants.

    Registration is CLOSED for on-site participants (contact us if you are
    already an APS user and want to register).

Due to how long it takes to get site access at the APS, on-site registration is closed.
However, we do have a couple of slots still open. If you are already an APS user
and want to register for the workshop, contact us and we will see if it's possible.

Remote participant registration is available to everyone. Follow this link:

Lodging and Travel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On-site participants are responsible for their own lodging and travel. We recommend
participants plan to arrive Monday (11/4) and leave Friday morning (11/8).
Rooms are available at the `Argonne Guest House <https://www.anlgh.org/>`_.

More information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Course topics:

*   Basic principles of SAXS
*   Critical sample preparation and data collection procedures, including
    online size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-SAXS)
*   Evaluating data quality
*   Basic data processing including size (R\ :sub:`g`, D\ :sub:`max`), molecular weight, the P(r)
    function, and real space reconstructions
*   What you need to know for publication
*   Overview of several advanced and emerging methods
*   Hands-on tutorials with data processing software
*   Hands-on data collection and analysis at the beamline

While the primary purpose of the course is educational, on-site participants may bring a
limited number (1-2) of their own research samples. Standard protein
samples will be available to all on-site participants for training purposes.

Participants will be assigned into small groups for 4 hour data collection slots
starting Wednesday afternoon and running through Thursday evening (11 pm). If
you are coming as a group or if you need a particular time slot, please notify
Jesse Hopkins (jhopkins1@iit.edu) for scheduling. Data analysis help is available
in parallel with the data collection on Thursday, but it is not a formal tutorial.

While BioCAT supports SEC-SAXS, SEC-MALS-SAXS, and batch mode SAXS, due to
time constraints students will be limited to only SEC-SAXS data collection.
Please read our guide on `how to design a SAXS experiment <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_design.rst>`_
and `how to prepare your SAXS samples <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_prepare.rst>`_.

If you have questions, please contact Jesse Hopkins (jhopkins1@iit.edu).

Confirmed speakers:

*   Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT, APS)
*   Srinivas Chakravarthy (BioCAT, APS)
*   Xiaobing Zuo (Sector 12, APS)
*   Tobin Sosnick (U. Chicago)
*   Todd Washington (U. Iowa)
*   Kushol Gupta (U. Pennsylvania)
