            BioCAT is offering its seventh intensive HOW-TO course in BioSAXS.
            Students will have four days of virtual lectures and hands-on
            software tutorials on the basics of BioSAXS data collection and
            processing from expert practitioners in the field. Students will
            also be able to mail in samples for data collection on the BioCAT
            beamline (Sector 18 at the APS) before the course, and there will
            be time during the workshop to get help with analysis of their own
            data.

            The course will take place from 3/29/21 to 4/1/21 and is entirely
            virtual (via BlueJeans). See the schedule below for details.

Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All participants this year will be remote participants. The course will provide
a virtual set of lectures and tutorials via BlueJeans, and participants will be
able to mail in samples for SAXS data collection at BioCAT the week before the
workshop. Participants will be able to ask questions during both lectures and
tutorials, and will have time to get help with analysis of the data collected
from their mail-in samples. They will also receive downloads of all course
materials, including lecture slides and tutorials.

There is no cost associated with the workshop, but registration is limited to
15 participants, in order to allow for data collection and one-on-one and/or
small-group interactions between participants and instructors. Registration is
on a first-come first-served basis.

How to register
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Registration is CLOSED.

More information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Course topics:

*   Basic principles of SAXS
*   Critical sample preparation and data collection procedures, including
    online size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-SAXS)
*   Evaluating data quality
*   Basic data processing including size (R\ :sub:`g`, D\ :sub:`max`), molecular
    weight, the P(r) function, and real space reconstructions
*   What you need to know for publication
*   Overview of several advanced and emerging methods
*   Hands-on tutorials with data processing software

While the primary purpose of the course is educational, participants may
mail-in a limited number (1-2) of their own research samples for data
collection the week before the course.

While BioCAT supports SEC-SAXS, SEC-MALS-SAXS, and batch mode SAXS, due to
time constraints students will be limited to only SEC-SAXS data collection.
Please read our guide on `how to design a SAXS experiment <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_design.rst>`_
and `how to prepare your SAXS samples <{filename}/pages/users_howto_saxs_prepare.rst>`_.

If you have questions, please contact Jesse Hopkins (jhopkins1@iit.edu).

Confirmed speakers:

*   Jesse Hopkins (BioCAT, APS)
*   Srinivas Chakravarthy (BioCAT, APS)
*   Richard Gillilan (MacCHESS, CHESS)
*   Kushol Gupta (U. Pennsylvania)
*   Steve Meisburger (Cornell U.)
*   Javier Perez (SWING, Synchrotron SOLEIL)
*   Tobin Sosnick (U. Chicago)
