BioCAT offered its third MuscleX workshop entitled “Sarcomeric regulation 
mechanisms in health and disease” from May 18 -19 2023. This entirely virtual 
workshop had 200 registered attendees. The workshop started with an introductory 
presentation of the scientific missions supported at BioCAT followed by a series
of 13 scientific presentations highlighting recent muscle studies using x-ray 
diffraction and/or other structural techniques. Topical areas that were 
covered were 1) Thick filament-based regulation, 2) New insights into thin
filament regulation, 3) Titin and muscle regulation, 4) MyBPC and regulation 
of thick and thin filament, and 5) Translational studies on structural bases 
of muscle diseases. Speakers came from several US states, the UK, Italy and 
Germany. Of the 13 speakers, eight of them were at an early career stage. 
Speakers included Thomas Irving (BioCAT, APS, USA), Weikang Ma (BioCAT, 
APS, USA), Yanhong Wang (King’s College London, UK), Ilaria Morotti (U 
Florence, Italy) , Saffie Mohran (University of Washington, USA),Neil Kad 
(University of Kent, UK), Davide Tamborrini (Max Planck Institute of Molecular 
Physiology, Germany), Anthony Hessel (University of Muenster, Germany), 
Caterina Squarci (U Florence, Italy), Maicon Landim-Vieira (Florida State 
University, USA), Samantha Harris (U Arizona Tucson, USA), Vivek Jani 
(Johns Hopkins University, USA), Farid Moussavi- Harami (University of 
Washington, USA).
