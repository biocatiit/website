To promote the use of two NIH P30 Centers that are National Resources for the
study of striated muscle; the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT:
funded by NIGMS) at Argonne National Laboratory and the Center for Translational
Muscle Research (CTMR: funded by NIAMS) are offering Multiscale Structural and
Functional Studies for Striated Muscle workshop following the `Myofilament
Meeting <https://cvrc.wisc.edu/myofilament-conference/#meeting-home>`_ in Madison
Wisconsin.

The goal of this workshop is to inform investigators about the resources and
expertise that these two Centers can provide, and to discuss what other
resources and services would be most useful. The workshop will take place on
May 24th from 1:30 pm to 4 pm at Madison Monona Terrace. See the schedule
below for details.
