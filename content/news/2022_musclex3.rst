            BioCAT is offering its third MuscleX workshop. The Biophysics
            Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT) is funded by National Institutes
            of Health (NIH) with its mission to operate state-of-the-art x-ray
            facilities for the study of the structure and dynamics of biological
            systems under non-crystalline conditions similar to their functional
            states in living tissues. We will have an introductory presentation
            of the scientific missions supported at BioCAT as well as a series
            of talks highlighting recent muscle studies either using X-ray
            diffraction or other structural techniques.

            The workshop will take place from 5/18/23 to 5/19/23 and will be
            entirely virtual (via Zoom). See the schedule below for details.
