BioCAT runs a SAXS coffee hour every two weeks on Mondays at 2 pm CDT. These
virtual SAXS coffee hours are informal Zoom hangouts with the SAXS beamline
scientists, where you can stop in and chat about whatever's on your mind.
They're a great way to get help with your data analysis, start planning your
next experiment, learn what's new at the beamline, and more. They're also a
chance to chat with and learn from other BioCAT users. To receive announcements
and the Zoom link for our coffee hour `sign up for our mailing list <{filename}/pages/mailing_list.rst>`_.
