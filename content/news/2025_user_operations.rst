BioCAT is very excited to be welcoming users back to the facility starting in
February. If you are interested in beam time next run, `please contact the
appropriate beamline scientist: Dr. Weikang Ma for muscle/fiber diffraction
and Dr. Max Watkins for solution SAXS. <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`_

If you want beamtime, `you can also check out our guide to applying for time.

A few key updates on how things have changed from before the APS-U dark period:

#.  The APS has a new proposal system, called the `Universal Proposal System (UPS).
    <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/About-Proposals/using-the-UPS>`_
    BioCAT users should put in either Standard General User Proposals (GUPs), which
    are good for 2 years and are the preferred proposal style at BioCAT, or Rapid
    Access GUPs, which are good for 1 run. For the upcoming spring run only
    Rapid Access proposals can be accepted, due to the proposal deadlines.

#.  On-site users must `request a dosimeter
    <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Users-Information/APS-Dosimetry-Information>`_ at
    least 3 business days in advance of their experiment in order to carry out
    their experiments.
